            "The personal computer market in the early 1980's consisted primarily of Apple and IBM computers.  Apple's systems ran a proprietary operating system developed by Apple, while IBM machines primarily ran PC-DOS. As the demand for personal computers began to grow, IBM decided to license the DOS operating system to other manufacturers.  These companies began producing personal computers that were called PC clones or IBM compatibles.\nAs several other manufacturers began producing PCs, supplies grew and costs began to drop.  This enabled more people to afford PCs and sales of IBM compatibles began to dominate the personal computer market.  It wasn't long until the new manufacturers' PC sales surpassed the number of computers sold directly by IBM.  The Apple Macintosh also gained substantial market share when it was introduced in 1984, but the low cost and wide availability of IBM compatibles kept their sales strong.\nSales of IBM compatibles surged again in 1995, when Microsoft introduced the Windows 95 operating system.  However, by that time, the term \"IBM compatible\" had become almost irrelevant, since most PCs used Microsoft Windows as the primary operating system.  Also, PC manufacturers had been building their own computers for many years, and there were few similarities between IBM's own PCs and IBM compatibles.\nIn 2005, IBM stopped manufacturing personal computers.  The company that started the PC revolution is no longer in the market.  Therefore, the term \"IBM compatible\" is a bit outdated, though it can still be used to describe Windows-based computers.  The term \"PC\" is more appropriate, albeit a bit ambiguous, since Macs are technically PCs too.  Therefore, the term \"Windows computer\" seems to be the best way to describe a modern day IBM compatible."

The \"integrated\" aspect of the name describes how the controller is integrated into the drive itself.  IDE and ATA are often used synonymously since they both refer to the same type of hard drive.  However, ATA describes the interface while IDE describes the actual hard drive.\nThe first IDE standard (ATA-1) was released in 1994 and supported data transfer rates of 8.3 Mbps in DMA mode.  Enhanced IDE (ATA-2) was standardized in 1996 and supported data transfer rates up to 16.7 Mbps \u2013 twice the rate of the original standard.  The next several IDE standards were labeled using ATA versions (up to ATA-7), maxing out at 133 Mbps.  The IDE interface was eventually superseded by SATA, an even faster interface.\n2. Integrated Development Environment\nA software IDE is an application that developers use to create computer programs.  In this case, \"integrated\" refers to the way multiple development tools are combined into a single program.  For example, a typical IDE includes a source code editor, debugger, and compiler.  Most IDEs also provide a project interface that allows programmers to keep track of all files related to a project.  Many support version control as well.\nSome IDEs provide a runtime environment (RTE) for testing software programs.  When a program is run within the RTE, the developer can track each event that takes place within the application being tested.  This can be useful for finding and fixing bugs and locating the source of memory leaks.  Because IDEs provide a centralized user interface for writing code and testing programs, a programmer can make a quick change, recompile the program, and run the program again.

Memory sharing involves indirect communication since the OS manages RAM usage and allocation.  Message passing requires active communication between processes.  For example, one process may request exclusive access to a specific resource, such as a file, from another process.  Message passing is an effective way to ensure two applications do not access the same block of data at the same time.\nWhen actively passing messages between processes, it is important to avoid deadlocks and race conditions.  A deadlock may cause a process to become unresponsive, while a race condition may produce errors and unexpected results.\nIPC Examples\nBelow are some common ways operating systems use interprocess communication:\n\nFile access - limiting access to files on a local or remote storage device to one process at a time\nNetwork communication - ensuring data sent through a network socket does not overlap\nShared memory - allowing mulitple processes to use the same block of memory, often through the use of a buffer that dynamically allocates free memory\nSignals - sending system messages to processes to notify them of an event, similar to an interrupt\n"

It is often used in combination with a network detection system (IDS) and may also be called an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS).\nLike an IDS, an IPS may include hardware, software, or both.  It may also be configured for a network or a single system.  However, unlike IDSes, intrusion prevention systems are designed to prevent malicious activity, rather than simply detecting it.\nWhen an IDS detects suspicious activity, such as numerous failed login attempts, it may log the IP address.  If it detects a suspicious data transfer, it may check the packets against a database of known viruses to see if any any malicious code is being transferred.  When an intrusion detected, an IDS compares the activity to a set of rules designed to prevent malicious activities from taking place.  For example, when an IDS detects numerous failed logins, it may block the IP address from accessing any network devices.  If it detects a virus, the data may be quarantined or deleted before it reaches its destination.\nExamples of hardware-based IPSes include Cisco's IPS 4500 Series, IBM's Security Network \"GX\" systems, and HP's TippingPoint \"NX\" devices.

IPX was introduced in the 1980s and remained popular through the 1990s.  Since then, it has largely been replaced by the standard TCP\/IP protocol.\nIPX is the network layer of the IPX\/SPX protocol and SPX is the transport layer.  IPX has a similar function to the IP protocol and defines how data is sent and received between systems.  The SPX protocol is used to establish and maintain a connection between devices.  Together, the two protocols can be used to create a network connection and transfer data between systems.\nIPX is connectionless, meaning it does not require a consistent connection to be maintained while packets are being sent from one system to another.  It can resume the transfer where it left off when a connection is temporarily dropped.  IPX only loads when a network connection is attempted, so it does not take up unnecessary resources.\nNOTE: In the 1990s, popular video games like Quake, Descent, and WarCraft 2 supported IPX for network gaming.  A service like Kali could be used to emulate an IPX connection over the Internet, enabling Internet gaming.

Each three-digit section can include a number from 0 to 255, which means the total number of IPv4 addresses available is 4,294,967,296 (256 x 256 x 256 x 256 or 2^32).\nEach computer or device connected to the Internet must have a unique IP address in order to communicate with other systems on the Internet.  Because the number of systems connected to the Internet is quickly approaching the number of available IP addresses, IPv4 addresses are predicted to run out soon.  When you consider that there are over 6 billion people in the world and many people have more than one system connected to the Internet (for example, at home, school, work, etc.), it is not surprising that roughly 4.3 billion addresses is not enough.\nTo solve this problem, a new 128-bit IP system, called IPv6, has been developed and is in the process of replacing the current IPv4 system.  During this transitional process from IPv4 to IPv6, systems connected to the Internet may be assigned both an IPv4 and IPv6 address."

This system assigns each computer a 32-bit numeric address, such as 120.121.123.124.  However, with the growth of computers connected to the Internet, the number of available IP addresses are predicted to run out in only a few years.  This is why IPv6 was introduced.\nIPv6, also called IPng (or IP Next Generation), is the next planned version of the IP address system.  (IPv5 was an experimental version used primarily for streaming data.)  While IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which increases the number of possible addresses by an exponential amount.  For example, IPv4 allows 4,294,967,296 addresses to be used (2^32).  IPv6 allows for over 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 IP addresses.  That should be enough to last awhile.\nBecause IPv6 allows for substantially more IP addresses than IPv4, the addresses themselves are more complex.  They are typically written in this format:\nhhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh\nEach \"hhhh\" section consists of a four-digit hexadecimal number, which means each digit can be from 0 to 9 and from A to F.  An example IPv6 address may look like this:\nF704:0000:0000:0000:3458:79A2:D08B:4320\nBecause IPv6 addresses are so complex, the new system also adds extra security to computers connected to the Internet.  Since there are so may IP address possibilities, it is nearly impossible to guess the IP address of another computer.  While most computer systems today support IPv6, the new Internet procotol has yet to be fully implemented.  During this transitional process, computers are often assigned both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.  By 2008, the U.S. government has mandated that all government systems use IPv6 addresses, which should help move the transition along."

Several web-based clients are also available, including KiwiIRC and Mibbit.\nIn order to join an IRC conversation, you must choose a username and a channel.  Your username, also called a handle, can be whatever you want.  It may include letters and numbers, but not spaces.  A channel is a specific chat group within an IRC network where users can talk to each other.  Some networks publish lists of available channels, while others require you to manually enter channel names in order to join them.  Channels always begin with a hashtag followed by a name that represents their intended chat topic, such as \"#teenchat,\" \"#politics,\" or \"#sports\".  Some IRC channels require a password while others are open to the public.\nWhen you join a channel, the chat window will begin displaying messages people are typing.  You can join the conversation by typing your own messages.  While channel members can type whatever they want, popular channels are often moderated.  That means human operators or automated bots may kick people out of the channel and even ban users who post offensive remarks or spam the channel with repeated messages.\nWhile IRC was designed as a public chat service, it supports other features such as private messaging and file transfers.  For example, you can use an IRC command (which typically begins with a forward slash \"\/\") to request a private chat session with another user.  Then you can use another IRC command to send the user a file from your local system.\nNOTE: IRC was a popular way for users to connect online before social media became prevalent in the early 2000s.

Some ISPs now offer high-speed fiber connections, which provide Internet access through fiber optic cables.  Companies like Comcast and Cox provide cable connections, while companies like AT&T and Verizon provide DSL Internet access.\nTo connect to an ISP, you need a modem and an active account.  When you connect a modem to the telephone or cable outlet in your house, it communicates with your ISP.  The ISP verifies your account and assigns your modem an IP address.  Once you have an IP address, you are connected to the Internet.  You can use a router (which may be a separate device or built into the modem) to connect multiple devices to the Internet.

It handles the request and sends it to the CPU, interrupting the active process.  When the ISR is complete, the process is resumed.\nA basic example of an ISR is a routine that handles keyboard events, such as pressing or releasing a key.  Each time a key is pressed, the ISR processes the input.  For example, if you press and hold the right arrow key in a text file, the ISR will signal to the CPU that the right arrow key is depressed.  The CPU sends this information to the active word processor or text editing program, which will move the cursor to the right.  When you let go of the key, the ISR handles the \"key up\" event.  This interrupts the previous \"key down\" state, which signals to the program to stop moving the cursor.\nSimilar to Newton's law of inertia (an object in motion tends to stay in motion), computer processes continue to run unless interrupted.  Without an interrupt request, a computer will remain in its current state.  Each input signal causes an interrupt, forcing the CPU to process the corresponding event.\nMany types of hardware devices, including internal components and external peripherals can sent interrupts to the CPU.  Examples include keyboards, mice, sound cards, and hard drives.  A device driver enables communication between each of these devices and the CPU.

Both raster graphics and vector graphics can be scaled, but they produce different results.\nRaster Image Scaling\nA raster graphic is a bitmap image comprised of individual pixels.  Examples include JPEG and PNG files.  The process of scaling raster graphics is also called \"resampling,\" in which pixels are mapped to a new grid, which may be smaller or larger than the original matrix.\nScaling down a raster graphic may cause a slight decrease in image quality since the pixels are squeezed into a smaller grid.  Colors must be blended and edges are often smoothed out using a process called anti-aliasing.  A good image scaling algorithm or \"scaler\" will keep most of the image detail when scaling down an image.  The further an image is scaled down, the less detail can be maintained.\nScaling up a raster graphic also decreases the image quality.  Generally, increasing the size of a digital image will cause it to look blurry.  The larger the image is scaled, the fuzzier it will appear.  Anti-aliasing can be used to smooth out the edges, but a scaled-up image will not look as clear as the original image.\nVector Image Scaling\nVector graphics, such as an .SVG or .AI file, are comprised of points and lines, also called paths.  These paths can be scaled up or down with no loss of quality.  Instead of mapping pixels to another grid, vector image scaling simply moves the points within the image.\nSince vector graphics are not defined by pixels, they appear sharp at both small and large sizes.  For this reason, company logos and application icons are often designed as vector graphics.  When published in a software application or website, the images can be scaled to a specific size and then saved as a raster graphic.\nNOTE: \"Video Upscaling\" is the process of scaling video for a higher-resolution display.  The goal is to make a lower-resolution video look sharp at a higher resolution.  For example, an HD video might be upscaled to 4K.  A good upscaling algorithm will keep as much detail as possible at the higher resolution, but cannot make the video look as sharp as a video originally recorded in 4K."

Most Web browsers also include an Import option that allows users to import saved bookmarks and other settings.\nWhile the Import command can serve a number of different purposes, its main function is to import file types that cannot be opened with the standard \"Open...\" command.  Therefore, if you want to import unconventional types of data into an application, the File &rarr; Import... command may be your best bet.\nMany programs also include an Export command, which is used for saving data in a specific format."

            "Impressions track how many times a webpage or element on a webpage is viewed.  It is one of the standard metrics used in website analytics software.  The term \"impressions\" most often refers to page impressions, which is synonymous with page views.  Each time a page is viewed, a page impression is counted.  Therefore, a single visitor can rack up multiple impressions on a website by visiting multiple pages.\nUnique impressions, or page views by different visitors, are useful for measuring the number of daily unique visitors to a website.  Website analytics software may record unique impressions by either saving a 24 hour cookie on visitors' browsers or by resetting the record of unique visitors at the start of each day.  Most analytics software records both total and unique impressions.  These two metrics can be used to determine the average number of pages visitors view before leaving the website.\nWhile impressions typically refer to page views, they may also define how many times individual elements on a webpage are viewed.  For example, in online advertising, \"ad impressions\" track the number of times individual advertisements are displayed.  If a webpage contains three ad units, each page view will produce three ad impressions.  By tracking the number of ad impressions, webmasters can monitor the performance of individual ads.  This information can be used in combination with RPM, or revenue per 1,000 page views, to determine the ideal amount of ads for each webpage."

This significantly speeds up searching and sorting operations on data referenced by the index.  Indexes often include information about each item in the list, such as metadata or keywords, that allows the data to be searched via the index instead of reading through each file individually.\nFor example, a database program such as Microsoft Access may generate an index of entries in a table.  When an SQL query is run on the database, the program can quickly scan the index file to see what entries match the search string.  Search engines also use indexes to store a large list of Web pages.  These indexes, such as those created by Google and Yahoo!, are necessary for quickly generating search results.  If search engines had to scan through millions of pages each time a user submitted a search, it would take roughly forever.  Fortunately, by using search indexes, Web searches can be performed in less than a second instead of several hours.\nThe term \"index\" can also be used as a verb, which not surprisingly means to create an index.  It may also refer to adding a new item to an existing index.  For example, Mac OS X 10.4 and later indexes the hard disk to create a searchable index for Apple's Spotlight search utility.  Google's \"Googlebot\" crawls the Web on a regular basis, adding new Web pages to the Google index.  While most database and hard disk indexes are updated on-the-fly, search engine indexes are only updated every few hours, days, or even weeks.  This is why newly published Web pages may not show up in search engine results.  While it may be a frustration for Web developers, it is a small price to pay for the convenience of super-fast Web searches."

Small influencers may have under 100,000 followers, while the most popular influencers have several million followers.  Some influencers build their follower base from scratch by posting photos, videos, or tweets that gain a lot of attention.  Other influencers use their existing celebrity status to build a follower base.\nAn influencer must also have expertise or authority in his or her fields of influence.  For example, a weight-lifting champion may have the credibility to promote workout equipment and training videos.  An experienced cook may be able to influence people's decisions regarding diet and nutrition.  A technology expert may recommend specific hardware and software products.\nInfluencers often sign contracts with companies, which may require that the influencer publishes a certain number of posts per week or month.  The company may also require specific words, mentions, or hashtags.  For example, a clothing company might pay an influencer an ongoing fee to post at least two photos of the person wearing the brand each week.  Companies may also pay influencers a one-time fee for a single post or a series of posts.  This is a common way to promote brand launches or local events, such as concerts.\nNOTE: In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) instituted rules influencers must follow when promoting brands online.  For example, Instagram posts must include wording that clearly states when they have been sponsored."

When a file is created in the Linux file system, it is assigned an inode number and a filename.  This linked pair allows the filename to be changed without affecting the file ID in the system.  The same holds true when renaming directories, which are treated as files in Linux.\nFile data is stored across one or more blocks on the storage device.  An inode includes a pointer to this data but does not contain the actual data.  Therefore, all inodes are relatively small, regardless of the size of the files they identify.\nModern file systems provide a hierarchical directory structure (folders) to make it easier to organize files.  However, in Linux, files are not actually stored in directories.  Instead, directories only contain filenames and their associated inode IDs.  The ID references an inode in the Linux inode table, which points to the storage blocks where the file data is stored.\nNOTE: Each Linux storage device has an inode limit, which is defined when the disk is formatted.  In rare cases, when many small files are created, the inode limit may be reached before the full storage capacity has been used."

The Earlybird filter adds a slight blur to the image, warms the colors, and vignettes the corners, giving photos a softer look.  You can also make more drastic changes to photos using a filter like \"1977,\" which makes images look like vintage photographs taken with an old camera.\nThe two primary ways to use Instagram are the Instagram website (Instagram.com) and the Instagram app.  The website allows you to upload images, manage your photos, apply filters, and share them with your friends.  The app allows you to take pictures with your iPhone or Android device and immediately apply the filter of your choice.

Some examples include:\n\nWeb \u2013 a collection of billions of webpages that you can view with a web browser\nEmail \u2013 the most common method of sending and receiving messages online\nSocial media \u2013 websites and apps that allow people to share comments, photos, and videos\nOnline gaming \u2013 games that allow people to play with and against each other over the Internet\nSoftware updates \u2013 operating system and application updates can typically downloaded from the Internet\n\nIn the early days of the Internet, most people connected to the Internet using a home computer and a dial-up modem.  DSL and cable modems eventually provided users with \"always-on\" connections.  Now mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, make it possible for people to be connected to the Internet at all times.  The Internet of Things has turned common appliances and home systems into \"smart\" devices that can be monitored and controlled over the Internet.  As the Internet continues to grow and evolve, you can expect it to become an even more integral part of daily life."

            "The Internet of Things, commonly abbreviated \"IoT,\" is an umbrella term that refers to anything connected to the Internet.  It includes traditional computing devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, but also includes a growing list of other devices that have recently become Internet enabled.  Examples include home appliances, automobiles, wearable electronics, security cameras, and many other things.\nIn order for a device to be part of the Internet of Things, it must be able to communicate with other devices.  Therefore, it requires some type of built-in wired or wireless communication.  Most IoT devices are Wi-Fi enabled, but Bluetooth can also be used to transfer data to nearby devices.  Anything that connects directly to the Internet must have a unique IP address, which is one of the reasons the adoption of IPv6 has been so important.\nIoT devices are commonly called \"smart devices,\" since they are able to communicate with other things.  For example, you can't control a traditional oven when you are away from home.  However, a smart oven that is connected to the cloud can be accessed remotely via a web interface or an app.  You can check the status of the oven and start preheating it before you get home.  Other smart home devices, such as smart thermostats, light fixtures, wall outlets, and window treatments are considered part of the IoT since they can be accessed and controlled over the Internet.\nAlong with the capacity to communicate, many IoT devices also include an array of sensors that provide useful information.  For example, a wearable device may include sensors that track your heart rate and activity level.  It can automatically upload your data to your personal account on the Internet.  A security system might include motion detectors that send you an alert if any suspicious activity is recorded.  Lighting systems can be automated using sensors that detect how dark it is outside.\nWhile the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, it provides promising opportunities for the future.  For example, connecting medical devices to the Internet will make it easier for doctors to track patients' health, providing more consistent data and requiring fewer appointments.  Agricultural products will be able to self-adjust based on weather forecasts, creating more efficient farming methods.  Internet-connected cars will communicate with each other, providing better traffic information and paving the way for self-driving cars.  In time, the Internet of Things will become less of an abstract idea and more of a way of life."

            "An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code.  This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts.  Common interpreters include Perl, Python, and Ruby interpreters, which execute Perl, Python, and Ruby code respectively.\nInterpreters and compilers are similar, since they both recognize and process source code.  However, a compiler does not execute the code like an interpreter does.  Instead, a compiler simply converts the source code into machine code, which can be run directly by the operating system as an executable program.  Interpreters bypass the compilation process and execute the code directly.\nSince interpreters read and execute code in a single step, they are useful for running scripts and other small programs.  Therefore, interpreters are commonly installed on Web servers, which allows developers to run executable scripts within their webpages.  These scripts can be easily edited and saved without the need to recompile the code.\nWhile interpreters offer several advantages for running small programs, interpreted languages also have some limitations.  The most notable is the fact that interpreted code requires an interpreter to run.  Therefore, without an interpreter, the source code serves as a plain text file rather than an executable program.  Additionally, programs written for an interpreter may not be able to use built-in system functions or access hardware resources like compiled programs can.  Therefore, most software applications are compiled rather than interpreted."

            "An interrupt is a signal sent to the processor that interrupts the current process.  It may be generated by a hardware device or a software program.\nA hardware interrupt is often created by an input device such as a mouse or keyboard.  For example, if you are using a word processor and press a key, the program must process the input immediately.  Typing \"hello\" creates five interrupt requests, which allows the program to display the letters you typed.  Similarly, each time you click a mouse button or tap on a touchscreen, you send an interrupt signal to the device.\nAn interrupt is sent to the processor as an interrupt request, or IRQ.  Each input device has a unique IRQ setting, or priority.  This prevents conflicts and ensures common input devices, such as keyboards and mice, are prioritized.\nSoftware interrupts are used to handle errors and exceptions that occur while a program is running.  For example, if a program expects a variable to be a valid number, but the value is null, an interrupt may be generated to prevent the program from crashing.  It allows the program to change course and handle the error before continuing.  Similarly, an interrupt can be used to break an infinite loop, which could create a memory leak or cause a program to be unresponsive.\nBoth hardware and software interrupts are processed by an interrupt handler, also called an interrupt service routine, or ISR.  When a program receives an interrupt request, the ISR handles the event and the program resumes.  Since interrupts are often as brief as a keystroke or mouse click, they are often processed in less than a millisecond."

            "An intranet is a private network that can only be accessed by authorized users.  The prefix \"intra\" means \"internal\" and therefore implies an intranet is designed for internal communications.  \"Inter\" (as in Internet) means \"between\" or \"among.\"  Since there is only one Internet, the word \"Internet\" is capitalized.  Because many intranets exist around the world, the word \"intranet\" is lowercase.\nSome intranets are limited to a specific local area network (LAN), while others can be accessed from remote locations over the Internet.  Local intranets are generally the most secure since they can only be accessed from within the network.  In order to access an intranet over a wide area network (WAN), you typically need to enter login credentials.\nIntranets serve many different purposes, but their primary objective is to facilitate internal communication.  For example, a business may create an intranet to allow employees to securely share messages and files with each other.  It also provides a simple way for system administrators to broadcast messages and roll out updates to all workstations connected to the intranet.\nMost intranet solutions provide a web-based interface for users to access.  This interface provides information and tools for employees and team members.  It may include calendars, project timelines, task lists, confidential files, and a messaging tool for communicating with other users.  The intranet website is commonly called a portal and can be accessed using a custom intranet URL.  If the intranet is limited to a local network, it will not respond to external requests.\nExamples of intranet services include Microsoft SharePoint, Huddle, Igloo, and Jostle.  While some services are open source and free of charge, most intranet solutions require a monthly fee.  The cost is usually related to the number of users within the intranet."

            "Iteration is the repetition of a function or process in a computer program.  Iterations of functions are common in computer programming, since they allow multiple blocks of data to be processed in sequence.  This is typically done using a \"while loop\" or \"for loop\" (see the examples below).  These loops will repeat a process until a certain number or case is reached.  Recursive functions also use iteration, though instead of repeating a process, the entire function repeats itself.\nWhile loop: &nbsp; while (x &lt; 30) { ... x++; }\nFor loop: &nbsp; for (x=0; x&lt;30; x++) { ... }\nA practical example of how iterations are used is a PHP Web page that lists data from a table in a database.  In order to display the table on the Web, the function might write each row in HTML using data from the database until the last row of data is reached.  In this case, each row of the table would be created by an iteration of the PHP function.\nIterated functions are frequently used in both Web scripts and software programs.  They can be simple functions like the one in the example above or complex loops that contain nested loops, which may call additional functions.  The amazing thing is that even these complex loops typically only take a fraction of a second to complete."

However, since it is a mobile operating system, iOS is designed around touchscreen input, rather than a keyboard and mouse.  For example, applications, or \"apps,\" can be opened by a single tap, rather than a double-click.  Different screens can be viewed by swiping your finger across the screen, rather than clicking on open windows.\nSince iOS is designed to be simple and easy to use, it does not include several features found in a traditional operating system.  For example, you cannot manage files and folders like you can in Mac OS X or Windows.  You also have limited access to iOS system settings.  Instead of modifying application preferences from within each program, most settings need to be adjusted within the Settings app.  Additionally, while you can run multiple programs at once, you can only view one open program at a time.\nWhile Apple's iOS provides a more basic user interface than Mac OS X, each new version adds more features.  For example, iOS 2 provided access to the App Store, which allowed users to download and install third-party apps on their iPhones.  iOS 3 added copy and paste functionality and iPad support.  iOS 4 was the first version to support multitasking and added the GameCenter feature.  iOS 5 introduced the Siri voice assistant (only available on the iPhone 4S), and provided new cloud connectivity features."
