But is it a welcome sight in the computer science world.  OASIS is a non-profit, global consortium that supports the development and adoption of e-business standards.\nWhile it won't quench your thirst in the middle of the desert, OASIS does provide several useful technology standards.  Common standards regulated by the OASIS consortium include protocols, file formats, and markup languages.  Hardware and software companies often work with OASIS to develop and institute standards that are efficient and effective.\nThe standards produced by OASIS are open standards, which means they can be used by any company or organization.  This allows multiple companies to develop products based on the same standard, which offers a high degree of interoperability between different computer systems.  For example, a file format standardized by OASIS may be supported by several different programs.  Because each program can save files in the same format, the files can be opened by any of the programs without needing to be converted or translated.  This makes transferring files between applications or even different systems a seamless process."

It is commonly used to recognize text in scanned documents, but it serves many other purposes as well.\nOCR software processes a digital image by locating and recognizing characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols.  Some OCR software will simply export the text, while other programs can convert the characters to editable text directly in the image.  Advanced OCR software can export the size and formatting of the text as well as the layout of the text found on a page.\nOCR technology can be used to convert a hard copy of a document into an electronic version (or soft copy).  For example, if you scan a multipage document into a digital image, such as a TIFF file, you can load the document into an OCR program, which will recognize the text and convert the document to an editable text file.  Some OCR programs allow you to scan a document and convert it to a word processing document in a single step.\nWhile OCR technology was originally designed to recognize printed text, it can be used to recognize and verify handwritten text as well.  For example, postal services such as USPS use OCR software to automatically process letters and packages based on the address.  The algorithm checks the scanned information against database of existing addresses to confirm the mailing address.  The Google Translate app includes OCR technology that works with your device's camera.  It allows you to capture the text from documents, magazines, signs, and other objects and translate it to another language in real-time."

These layers include the following, from bottom to top:\n\nSubstrate - the foundational structure that supports the panel; typically made out of glass or plastic\nAnode - a transparent layer that removes electrons when electrical current flows through it\nConductive Layer - contains organic molecules or polymers such as polyaniline that transfer current to the emissive layer\nEmissive Layer - contains organic molecules or polymers such as polyfluorene that light up when current is passed through them\nCathode - injects electrons into the other layers when current flows through it\nCover - the top protective layer of the screen; typically made out of glass or plastic\n\nHow does an OLED work?\nOLEDs display light using a process called electrophosphorescence.  While this may sound like an intimidating term, the process is relatively simple.  Electrical current flows from the cathode (negatively charged) to the anode (positively charged), causing electrons to move to the emissive layer.  These electrons find \"holes\" (where atoms missing electrons) in the conductive layer and produce light when they fill these holes.  The color of the light depends on the organic molecule that the current passed through in the emissive layer.\nSince the diodes in OLED displays light up individually, there is no need for a backlight.  This means OLEDs can have darker blacks than LED\/LCD displays and use less electricity.  They are also thinner and may be curved or even bendable.  While OLEDs have many advantages over LED\/LCD displays, it has been expensive to produce large, reliable OLED screens.  Therefore, OLEDs have been more common in small electronics, such as smartphones and tablets.  As OLED production costs decrease and reliability increases, the technology will become more commonly used in larger screens, such as televisions and computer monitors."

Individual characters may be defined as objects, which allows them to have different appearances, skills, and abilities.  They may also perform different tasks in the game, which are run using each object's specific methods.\nObject-oriented programming makes it easier for programmers to structure and organize software programs.

It was called \"Mac OS X\" until version OS X 10.8, when Apple dropped \"Mac\" from the name.\nOS X was originally built from NeXTSTEP, an operating system designed by NeXT, which Apple acquired when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997.  Like NeXTSTEP, OS X is based on Unix and uses the same Mach kernel.  This kernel provides OS X with better multithreading capabilities and improved memory management compared to Mac OS Classic.  While the change forced Mac developers to rewrite their software programs, it provided necessary performance improvements and scalability for future generations of Macs.\nThe OS X desktop interface is called the Finder and includes several standard features.  OS X does not have a task bar like Windows, but instead includes a menu bar, which is fixed at the top of the screen.  The menu bar options change depending on what application is currently running and is only hidden when full screen mode is enabled.  The Finder also includes a Dock, which is displayed by default on the bottom of the screen.  The Dock provides easy one-click access to frequently used applications and files.  The Finder also displays a user-selectable desktop background that serves as a backdrop for icons and open windows.\nWhen you start up a Mac, OS X loads automatically.  It serves as the fundamental user interface, but also works behind the scenes, managing processes and applications.  For example, when you double-click an application icon, OS X launches the corresponding program and provides memory to the application while it is running.  It reallocates memory as necessary and frees up used memory when an application is quit.  OS X also includes an extensive API, or library of functions, that developers can use when writing Mac programs.\nWhile the OS X interface remains similar to the original version released in 2001, it has gone through several updates, which have each added numerous new features to the operating system.  Below is a list of the different versions of OS X, along with their code names.\n\nMac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah)\nMac OS X 10.1 (Puma)\nMac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar)\nMac OS X 10.3 (Panther)\nMac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)\nMac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)\nMac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)\nMac OS X 10.7 (Lion)\nOS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)\nOS X 10.9 (Mavericks)\nOS X 10.10 (Yosemite)\n"

It begins with the physical layer of the transmitting system and travels through the other layers to the application layer.  Once the data reaches the application layer, it is processed by the receiving system.  In some cases, the data will move through the layers in reverse to the physical layer of the receiving computer.\nThe best way to explain how the OSI model works is to use a real life example.  In the following illustration, a computer is using a wireless connection to access a secure website.\nThe communications stack begins with the (1) physical layer.  This may be the computer's Wi-Fi card, which transmits data using the IEEE 802.11n standard.  Next, the (2) data link layer might involve connecting to a router via DHCP.  This would provide the system with an IP address, which is part of the (3) network layer.  Once the computer has an IP address, it can connect to the Internet via the TCP protocol, which is the (4) transport layer.  The system may then establish a NetBIOS session, which creates the (5) session layer.  If a secure connection is established, the (6) presentation layer may involve an SSL connection.  Finally, the (7) application layer consists of the HTTP connection to the website.\nThe OSI model provides a helpful overview of the way computer systems communicate with each other.  Software developers often use this model when writing software that requires networking or Internet support.  Instead of recreating the communications stack from scratch, software developers only need to include functions for the specific OSI layer(s) their programs use."

One example is over-the-air activation (OTAA), which allows you to wirelessly activate a new cell phone by simply typing a code or following specific steps.  This automated service provided by most mobile providers can save you a trip to a mobile phone service location when you buy a new phone.

For example, many programs include an \"Opacity\" setting that allows you to adjust the transparency of an image.\nTo understand opacity, it is important understand what \"opaque\" means.  An opaque object is completely impervious to light, which means you cannot see through it.  For example, a car door is completely opaque.  The window above the door, however, is not opaque, since you can see through it.  If the window is tinted, it is partially opaque and partially transparent.  The less transparent the window is, the higher its opacity.  In other words, transparency and opacity are inversely related.\nMost digital images are 100% opaque.  For example, if you open an image captured with a digital cameras, it will be completely opaque.  However, you can use an image editing application to adjust the opacity of the image.  This is especially useful when editing an image with multiple layers.  For instance, Adobe Photoshop allows you to adjust the opacity for each layer from 0 to 100.  0 is completely transparent (or invisible), while 100 is completely opaque.  By sliding the opacity of each layer somewhere in between 0 and 100, you can overlay multiple layers on top of each other, creating a multilayer image mosaic.\nNOTE: When saving a semi-transparent image, it is important to save the file in a format that supports multiple levels of opacity.  JPEG does not support transparency at all and GIF only supports fully transparent or fully opaque pixels.  The PNG format is the best choice since it includes an alpha channel, which stores an opacity setting for each pixel."

Open Firmware also builds the \"device tree,\" which locates internal and external devices connected to the computer.  Each device is then assigned a unique address so it can be used once the computer starts up.\nSeveral types of computers use Open Firmware, including PowerPC-based Macintosh systems, Sun Microsystems SPARC-based workstations, and IBM POWER systems.  (Most Windows-based PCs use the BIOS for the same purpose.)  Because Open Firmware is an \"open\" standard, devices that support Open Firmware can be typically be used in multiple Open Firmware-based systems.  For example, identical PCI cards could be used in both Sun and Macintosh-based computer systems.\nTo access the Open Firmware interface on a PowerPC-based Macintosh, press and hold \"Command-Option-O-F\" during startup.  On Sun systems, the Open Firmware interface is displayed at startup and can be accessed afterwards by pressing \"L1-A\" (or Stop-A) while the computer is running."

For example, if you create a plain text (.TXT) file in a text editor like Notepad and open it with another application like Microsoft Word.  Since plain text files store data in an open format, they can be opened by any text editor or word processor.\nConversely, a file saved in a proprietary format may only be opened by the corresponding application.  For example, only Apple Pages can open a .PAGES document.  Only Adobe Premiere can open a .PRPROJ file.\nIn recent years, many software companies have moved from proprietary formats to open ones.  Microsoft switched from proprietary Office file formats (.DOC, .XLS, .PPT) to open formats (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX) in 2007.  The new \"Open XML\" Office formats use standard Zip compression and contain data stored in plain XML.  Any application that supports the publicly-available Open XML specification can open them.  In 2008, Adobe made PDF an open standard.  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) now maintains the .PDF format specification.\nPartially Open Formats\nSome file formats are \"partially open,\" meaning the specification is made partially available for public use.  Other applications can open these files, but they may have limited editing and saving capabilities.  Examples of partially open formats include Photoshop documents (.PSD), CorelDRAW drawings (.CDR), and AutoCAD drawings (.DWG)."

Unlike commercial software, open source programs can be modified and distributed by anyone and are often developed as a community rather than by a single organization.  For this reason, the phrase \"open source community\" is commonly used to describe the developer of open source software development projects.\nSince the source code of an open source program can be modified by anyone, it makes sense that the software is also free to download and use.  The terms of use are often defined by the GNU General Public License, which serves as the software license agreement (SLA) for many open source programs.  Open source software development projects are often funded by donors with an interest in the project, by user donations, or through advertisements.  Some developers also generate revenue by selling documentation and help manuals for the software.  Other projects are funded by no more than a collective desire of developers to create a great program.\nSince open source software is free to use, there is typically no technical support included with the software.  Instead, users may need to rely on Web forums and user discussions to report bugs or get answers to their questions.  Fortunately, the most popular open source programs have an abundance of helpful resources available on the Web.  Some of the most well-known open source projects include the Linux operating system, the Mozilla Firefox Web browser, and the OpenOffice.org productivity suite.  Each of these projects have been developed by a community of developers and have gained levels of popularity that rival their commercial counterparts.\nOpen source software can be a cost-effective way to run many types of programs on your computer.  Just remember that since the programs are not backed by a commercial company, if you have problems using the software, you will most likely not be able to obtain technical support from the developer.  Of course, if you like to figure things out on your own or participate in online discussions, open source software may be just right for you."

It was originally developed by Apple in 2008 and is now maintained by the Khronos Group.  The first major operating system to support OpenCL was Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6), which was released in 2009.\nOpenCL provides an API that allows software programs to access multiple processors simultaneously to perform parallel processing.  Examples include CPUs, GPUs, digital signal processors (DSPs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).  By distributing the computing load across multiple processors, OpenCL increases processing efficiency and can substantially improve a program's performance.\nWhile OpenCL supports many different types of processors, it is most notably used to access the GPU for general computing tasks.  This technique, also called GPGPU, takes advantage of the GPU's processing power and allows it to assist the CPU in completing calculations.  Before OpenCL, the graphics processor would often remain idle while the CPU was running at full capacity.  OpenCL enables the GPU to assist the CPU in processing non-graphics-related computations.\nIn order to take advantage of OpenCL, both the hardware and software must support the OpenCL API.  Because of the performance advantage OpenCL provides, most video cards developed by NVIDIA and AMD now support OpenCL.  Many mobile graphics processors, such as those used in smartphones and tablets, support OpenCL as well."

Nearly all modern operating systems and hardware devices support OpenGL, making it an easy choice for graphics development.  Additionally, many video cards and integrated GPUs are optimized for OpenGL, allowing them to process OpenGL commands more efficiently than other graphics libraries.\nExamples of OpenGL commands include drawing polygons, assigning colors to shapes, applying textures to polygons (texture mapping), zooming in and out, transforming polygons, and rotating objects.  OpenGL is also used for managing lighting effects, such as light sources, shading, and shadows.  It can also create effects like haze or fog, which can be applied to a single object or an entire scene.\nOpenGL is commonly associated with video games because of its widespread use in 3D gaming.  It provides developers with an easy way to create crossplatform games or port a game from one platform to another.  OpenGL is also used as the graphics library for many CAD applications, such as AutoCAD and Blender.  Even Apple uses OpenGL as the foundation of the macOS Core Animation, Core Image, and Quartz Extreme graphics libraries.\nNOTE: OpenGL was originally developed and released by Silicon Graphics (SGI) in 1992.  The initial version was approved by an architectural review board, which included Microsoft, IBM, DEC and Intel.  In 2006, SGI passed development and maintenance of OpenGL to The Khronos Group."

Therefore, many users prefer to use a specific operating system.  For example, one user may prefer to use a computer with OS X instead of a Windows-based PC.  Another user may prefer an Android-based smartphone instead of an iPhone, which runs the iOS.\nWhen software developers create applications, they must write and compile them for a specific operating system.  This is because each OS communicates with the hardware differently and has a specific application program interface, or API, that the programmer must use.

After all, when you overclock a computer, you are altering the manufacturer's design of the machine.  For example, if there is not enough electrical current to to power the processor at the new rate, it may slow down or stop running completely.  Also, if the heat sink cannot sufficiently cool the processor running at the faster rate, it may overheat, causing your computer to freeze or crash.

If an application supports both modes, the Insert (INS) key can often be used to toggle between insert and overwrite mode.\nWhile in insert mode, text to the right of the cursor is shifted to the right as new text is entered.  For example, say you want to add the word \"and\" between \"five\" and \"six,\" in the string \"four, five, six.\"  You would move the cursor immediately before the word \"six,\" then type \"and\" (followed by a space).  The result would be \"four, five, and six.\" In overwrite mode, the word \"six\" would be overwritten by the word \"and,\" so the resulting string would read, \"four, five, and.\"  Overwrite mode simply replaces existing characters as you type.\n2) Replacing files\nThe term \"overwrite\" also refers to replacing old files with new ones.  If you try to save a document with the same filename as an existing document, you may be asked if you want to overwrite the file.
