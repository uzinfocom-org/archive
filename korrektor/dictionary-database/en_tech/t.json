It is categorized as a \"transport layer\" protocol since it creates and maintains connections between hosts.\nTCP compliments the Internet protocol (IP), which defines IP addresses used to identify systems on the Internet.  The Internet protocol provides instructions for transferring data while the transmission control protocol creates the connection and manages the delivery of packets from one system to another.  The two protocols are commonly grouped together and referred to as TCP\/IP.\nWhen data is sent over a TCP connection, the protocol divides it into individually numbered packets or \"segments.\"  Each packet includes a header that defines the source and destination and a data section.  Since packets can travel over the Internet using multiple routes, they may arrive at the destination in a different order than they were sent.   The transmission control protocol reorders the packets in the correct sequence on the receiving end.\nTCP also includes error checking, which ensures each packet is delivered as requested.  This is different than UDP, which does not check if each packet was successfully transmitted.  While the built-in error checking means TCP has more overhead and is therefore slower than UDP, it ensures accurate delivery of data between systems.  Therefore TCP is used for transferring most types of data such as webpages and files over the Internet.  UDP is ideal for media streaming which does not require all packets to be delivered."

Secure websites, for example, use TLS to deliver website content over HTTPS.  Email protocols, such as IMAP and SMTP, also support TLS.\nSecure protocols typically require a different port number than their non-secure counterparts.

It was introduced in 1999 as a more secure means of encrypting data transfers.  TLS 1.0 and 1.1 (introduced in 2006) were backward-compatible with SSL.  While this simplified the transition process, it also compromised security, since it allowed systems to use the less-secure SSL option.\nIn 2008, TLS 1.2 eliminated backward-compatibility with SSL.

TLS 1.3, introduced in 2018, added several additional security improvements.\nCommon web browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox, deprecated TLS 1.1 and earlier in 2018.

However, it also causes many \"pages\" of free space to be inaccessible, since they are pending deletion.  Once enough pages are marked for deletion, the TRIM command performs a \"garbage collection\" operation.  This action deletes large \"blocks\" of data all at once, allocating free space on the drive.\nIn order for TRIM to work, it must be supported by a device's hardware and software.

Tab Key\nThe tab key is located on the left side of the keyboard next to Q and enters the tab character (ASCII code: 9) when pressed.  If you are typing in a word processor, pressing Tab will move the cursor to the next \"tab stop.\"  Tab stops are fixed horizontal distances that are typically four to eight spaces long.  Pressing Tab at the beginning of a line can be used to indent text, such as the beginning of a paragraph in a text document or a line of source code in a program.  Pressing Tab between blocks of text can be used to horizontally align words in multiple lines.\nThe tab key is also used to highlight or \"focus\" different fields within a form.  When filling out a form in a software program or website, you can press Tab to jump to the next field.  For example, you might enter your first name in the \"First Name\" field, then press Tab to highlight the \"Last Name\" field.  This is called \"tabbing\" through the fields and allows you to quickly fill out forms without using a mouse.  If you need to go backwards, pressing Shift+Tab will typically highlight the previous field.\n2.

Instead of a single title bar, a tabbed window may include multiple tabs along the top.  Clicking one of the tabs will display the contents of the corresponding document.  \nTabs have become a common feature in web browsers since they make it possible to have several webpages open without cluttering your screen.  The tabbed document interface (TDI) has also become standard in other programs such as Adobe Photoshop and the OS X Finder.

Spreadsheets combine both purposes of a table by storing and displaying data in a structured format.\nDatabases often contain multiple tables, with each one designed for a specific purpose.  For example, a company database may contain separate tables for employees, clients, and suppliers.  Each table may include its own set of fields, based on what data the table needs to store.  In database tables, each field is considered a column, while each entry (or record), is considered a row.  A specific value can be accessed from the table by requesting data from an individual column and row.\nWebsites often use tables to display data in a structured format.  In fact, HTML has a &lt;table&gt; tag, as well as &lt;tr&gt; (table row) and &lt;td&gt; (table data) tags for specifying rows and columns.  Since many tables use the top row for header information, HTML also supports a &lt;th&gt; tag used to define the cells in the header row.

However, cascading style sheets (CSS) are now the preferred means of designing webpage layouts.\nSpreadsheets both store data and and display data in a table format.  Programs like Microsoft Excel and Apple Numbers provide a grid, or matrix of cells in which users can enter data.  Each cell is defined by a specific row\/column pair, such A3, which refers to the cell in the first column and third row of the table.

It can range from poorly-written functions to frameworks that are no longer supported.  In some cases, technical debt can be handled by rewriting code, while in others, developers may need to rewrite entire programs.\nAvoiding Technical Debt\nThe best way to manage technical debt is to avoid accumulating it in the first place.  This begins with architecting a program with a long-term plan.  A wise software engineer will design an application for the future, not just the current state of software and hardware.  Choosing \"future-proof\" programming languages and reliable frameworks are two important decisions in the architectural process.\nIt is also necessary to follow good coding practices to avoid technical debt.  For example, if the same logic is repeated multiple times within a program, it should be consolidated into a single class or function.  Otherwise, it will be more difficult to locate and update each instance in the future, especially if new developers are working on the project.  Commenting code is also essential for reviewing and updating code in the future.\nManaging Technical Debt\nThe two main ways to manage technical debt are to rewrite sections of code or start from scratch.  The best route depends on the size of the project and the amount of technical debt.\n1. Rewriting code\nRewriting or \"refactoring\" code is the most common way to handle technical debt.  For example, a senior developer may review code written by a junior developer and find ways to optimize performance.  It may also be necessary to update deprecated functions so that the code can run on a newer platform.  In some cases, large portions of code may need to be rewritten to work with a new API.  These types of updates are common in the programming world and are one of the reasons why developers release new versions.\n2. Starting from scratch\nIf the amount of technical debt is large enough, it may require more time to update the code than to write new a new program from scratch.  In some cases, it may be necessary to re-code an application in a new programming language that is compatible with modern software compilers.  Rebuilding an app from scratch is a significant investment, but it may provide additional benefits.  For example, a new application can take advantage of the latest hardware technologies and modern user interface elements."

Radio broadcasts began the late 1800s and the first television broadcasts started in the early 1900s.  Today, popular forms of telecommunications include the Internet and cellular phone networks.\nEarly telecommunications transmissions used analog signals, which were transferred over copper wires.  Today, telephone and cable companies still use these same lines, though most transmissions are now digital.  For this reason, most new telecommunications wiring is done with cables that are optimized for digital communication, such as fiber optic cables and digital phone lines.\nSince both analog and digital communications are based on electrical signals, transmitted data is received almost instantaneously, regardless of the distance.  This allows people to quickly communicate with others across the street or across the globe.  So whether you're watching TV, sending an email to a coworker, or talking on the phone with a friend, you can thank telecommunications for making it possible."

            "A teleconference is a meeting of people in different locations using telecommunications.  A basic teleconference may only include audio, while other types of teleconferences may include video and data sharing.  Some common examples include telephone conferences, videoconferences, and web meetings.\nThe most simple and widely used type of teleconference is a phone conference, since the only equipment required is a speakerphone.  If a project needs to be discussed between more than two people in different locations, they can all dial a conference phone number that will allow everybody to talk to each other at the same time.  A board meeting may also double as a teleconference if board members attend remotely.  Many board rooms include a conferencing system that allows people to \"teleconference in\" to the meeting by calling the conference phone number.  This allows remote board members to actively participate in a board meeting even if they are not physically present.\nTeleconferences may also include live video.  These types of teleconferences, often called videoconferences, allow people to see each other in real-time during a remote meeting.  A videoconference may be one-way, where one remote user or group is displayed on a video feed, or two-way, where both sides can see each other.  In the early days of videoconferencing, expensive equipment was required in order to set up a videoconference.  Today, you can simply use a computer's built-in video camera and free software such as Skype to videoconference with other users.\nThanks to the Internet, teleconferences may also include data sharing.  These types of conferences often use web browsers as the user interface and are therefore called web meetings.  For example, you can use a web-based service like Join.me to share your screen with other users.  You can even let another person control your screen, which is great for remote troubleshooting.  Businesses may use a web-based service like WebEx to host an online presentation for hundreds or even thousands of attendees.  When hosting a web presentation, the presenter controls the screen and is typically the only one who can be heard during the meeting.  Attendees are often provided with a chat window in which they can ask questions and interact with the presenter."

            "Telehealth is an umbrella term that encompasses health services provided using telecommunications technologies.  It includes everything from the electronic delivery of patient health information and prescriptions to remote interactions between patients and doctors in different locations.\nTelehealth has existed for decades, dating back to the invention of the telephone in the late 1800s.  It first enabled doctors and nurses to communicate over long distances and provide medical information to their patients over the phone.  The telephone provided a significant boost in medical care because patients were no longer limited by the expertise of doctors in their local area.\nAs technology has progressed, so has telehealth.  For example, the fax machine made it possible to transfer medical information between hospitals in minutes instead of days.  Pagers helped notify doctors and surgeons in emergency situations.  Modern technologies like smartphones and the Internet make it possible for medical professionals and patients to access health information anytime, anywhere.  Online services like MyChart and AthenaNet provide patients with direct access to their own health records, including test results, scans, and medications.\nRemote Healthcare\nWhile telehealth encompasses many types of medical services, it is often used to describe remote healthcare.  For example, a telehealth doctor may \"visit\" patients remotely using videoconferencing technology.  Patients can book remote appointments and a doctor can evaluate their condition over the video feed.  A more advanced type of telehealth, called telesurgery, allows doctors to perform remote surgery using a specialized robotic system."

For example, a network administrator may use a terminal to log in to a network and manage devices connected to the network.\nWith modern computers, the word \"terminal\" usually refers to a terminal program, or emulator, which provides a text-based interface for typing commands.  This type of program is often abbreviated \"TTY\" and may also be referred to as a command-line interface.  Terminal programs are available for all major computing platforms and are typically included with the operating system.

The four primary types of text alignment include left aligned, right aligned, centered, and justified.\n\nLeft Aligned - This setting is often referred to as \"left justified,\" but is technically called \"flush left.\"  It is typically the default setting when you create a new document.  Left aligned text begins each line along the left margin of the document.  As you type, the first word that does not fit on a line is placed at the left margin on the next line.  This results in a straight margin on the left and a \"ragged edge\" margin on the right.\nRight Aligned - This setting is also called \"right justified,\" but is technically known as \"flush right.\"  It aligns the beginning of each line of text along the right margin of the document.  As you type, the text expands to the left of the cursor.  If you type more than one line, the next line will begin along the right margin.  The result is a straight margin on the right and a \"ragged edge\" margin on the left.  Right justification is commonly used to display the company name and address near the top of a business document.\nCentered - As the name implies, centered text is placed in the center of each line.  As you type, the text expands equally to the left and right, leaving the same margin on both sides.  When you start a new line, the cursor stays in the center, which is where the next line begins.  Centered text is often used for document titles and may be appropriate for headers and footers as well.\nJustified - Justified text combines left and right aligned text.  When a block of text is justified, each line fills the entire space from left to right, except for the paragraph indent and the last line of a paragraph.  This is accomplished by adjusting the space between words and characters in each line so that the text fills 100% of the space.  The result is a straight margin on each side of the page.  Justified text is commonly used in newspapers and magazines and has become increasingly popular on the Web as well.\n\nIn most word processors, the text alignment options are typically located in the program's primary toolbar.  They are often displayed as a row of four icons, which include the left, centered, right, and justified alignment options.  These options may also be available in the program's Format menu.

Once a thermistor is calibrated, changes in electrical resistance can be accurately translated into changes in temperature.\nThermistors are commonly used in computers to monitor the ambient temperature of internal components.  For example, thermistors may be used to record the temperature near the CPU, RAM slots, and the power supply.  These thermistors are usually integrated into the computer's motherboard.  The actual temperature of components such as the processor and memory modules is typically measured by a diode that is integrated into the chip.\nComputers use the information recorded by thermistors to prevent overheating.  For example, if a processor is running near capacity for an extended period of time, the temperature may gradually increase.  When this happens, the computer might speed up the internal fans to increase airflow and cool the computer.  In extreme circumstances, such as when a laptop is used outside on a hot day, the fans may not be able to keep the computer at a safe temperature.  If the thermistors record a dangerously high temperature, the computer may shut down to avoid overheating and damaging the hardware."

Because several different timestamp formats exist, most modern programming languages have built-in timestamp conversion functions.\nA Unix timestamp is also known as \"epoch time,\" which is equivalent to the number of seconds since  January 1, 1970, at 12:00 AM GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).  This GMT (or \"UTC\") date\/time may be displayed by default on Unix and Linux devices (including Android) when a valid timestamp is not available.  In the western hemisphere, such as the United States, this date will appear as December 31, 1969.\nStoring a timestamp as an integer is efficient since it requires minimal storage space.  However, the number must be converted to a legible time format when displayed.  MySQL has a TIMESTAMP data type, which conveniently stores timestamps in the following format:\nYYYY-MM-DD  HH:MM:SS\nMySQL stores timestamps in UTC, which is based in England.  So January 16, 2021 at 10:15:30 AM US Central Time would be stored in a MySQL database as follows:\n2021-01-16 16:15:30\nIf converted to a timestamp in Linux, this time\/date would be represented as:\n1610813730\nTimestamps also have different resolutions or specificity.  In some cases, seconds are sufficient, while in others, milliseconds or even nanoseconds are required.  The Linux timestamp above would be 1610813730000 in milliseconds, which provides a resolution of one-thousandth of a second.  Computing operations may require timestamps with even higher resolution.  PHP includes a microtime() function that outputs a timestamp in microseconds, with a resolution of one-millionth of a second."

Therefore, toggle keys do not need to be held down when pressing other keys.  Some keyboards have lights on or near the toggle keys to let the user know if they are turned on or off.\nSome modern operating systems also display the status of toggle keys on the user's screen.

In security systems, a hard token is small card that displays an identification code used to log into a network.  When the card user enters the correct password, the card will display the current ID needed to log into the network.

It may take a second or two to display the tooltip, but when it does appear, it usually is a small box with a yellow background explaining what the icon represents.  For example, in Microsoft Word, when you roll over the disk icon, the tooltip \"Save\" appears.  This means clicking on the disk icon will save your document.  In Photoshop, when you roll over the wand icon, the text \"Magic Wand Tool (W)\" appears.  This indicates that clicking the the wand icon or pressing the W key will activate the magic wand selection tool.\nNot all programs incorporate tooltips, but most modern programs include them as part of a user-friendly interface.

By sliding your fingertip along the surface, you can move the cursor on the screen.  Similar to a mouse, touchpads can detect acceleration as well as linear motion.  This allows you to have refined control with slow movements and quickly move the cursor across the screen using a fast motion.\nSome touchpads have two buttons below them, which correspond to the left-click and right-click mouse buttons respectively.  In modern laptops, the buttons may be hidden in the bottom portion of the touchpad.  This allows for a larger touchpad surface, but you can press the lower left or lower right section of the touchpad to click the buttons.\nTouchpads may also include multi-touch technology, which is common on touchscreen devices.

Since touchscreen devices accept input directly through the screen, they do not require external input devices, such as mice and keyboards.  This makes touchscreens ideal for computer kiosks, as well as portable devices, such as tablets and smartphones.\nWhile a touchscreen may look like an ordinary display, the screen includes several extra layers that detect input.  The first layer is a hard protective layer that protects the actual display and the touchscreen components.  Beneath the protective layer is an electronic grid that detects input.  Most modern touchscreens use capacitive material for this grid, in which the electrical charge changes wherever the screen is touched.  Beneath the touchscreen layer is the LCD layer, which is used for the actual display.\nWhile early touchscreens could only detect a single point of input at a time, modern touchscreens support \"multi-touch\" input.  This technology, which was made popular by the original iPhone, enables the screen to detect multiple finger motions at once.  For example, on some touchscreen devices, you can rotate an image by twisting three fingers in a clockwise or counterclockwise motion.  Many touchscreen applications also allow you zoom in and out by spreading two fingers apart or pinching them together.\nThanks to multi-touch and other improvements in touchscreen technology, today's touchscreens are easier and more natural to use than they used to be.

This is because the Internet is made up of a network of networks, and two different computers may be on two separate networks in different parts of the world.  Therefore, if a computer is to communicate with another system on the Internet, it must send data through a series of small networks, eventually getting to the Internet backbone, and then again traveling to a smaller network where the destination computer resides.\nThese individual network connections, called \"hops,\" typically go unnoticed by the average user.  After all, why bother tracking all the various connections when you are only interested in communicating with the destination computer?  However, if a connection cannot be made or is taking a unusually long time, tracing the path of connections along the way can prove to be helpful.  This is exactly what the traceroute command does.\nTraceroute is a TCP\/IP utility that allows a user to trace a network connection from one location to another, recording every hop along the way.  The command can be run from a Unix or DOS command line by typing tracert [domain name], where [domain name] is either the domain name or the IP address of the system you are trying to reach.  A traceroute can also be done using various networking utilities, such as Apple's Network Utility for Mac OS X.\nWhen a traceroute is run, it returns a list of network hops and displays the host name and IP address of each connection.  It also returns the amount of time it took for each connection to take place (usually in milliseconds).  This shows if there were any delays in establishing the connection.  Therefore, if a network connection is slow or unresponsive, a traceroute can often explain why the problem exists and also show the location of the problem."

By linking to a trackback link, a webmaster can automatically inform the other website that he has added a link to one of site's pages.  However, in order for the trackback system to work, both websites must support trackback.  This is because the linking website needs to ping the linked website to let it know a link has been added.\nTrackback was first implemented by Movable Type blogging and Web design software in 2002.  Since then, other Web development tools, such as Wordpress and Typo, have also added trackback support.  This allows bloggers from all types of platforms to communicate with each other.  For example, a user might read a blog entry on another person's site and decide to post his own blog, responding to the original post.  If he adds a trackback link, the original blogger will see that the other user has linked to his blog.  Depending on the trackback settings, the new blog may also show up as a link at the end of the original blog.\nSince trackback requires multiple websites to support the trackback protocol, it continues to be used primarily for blogs.  However, some news websites now offer trackback links as well.  You can tell if a site supports trackback if there is a \"Trackback link\" or \"Trackback URL\" at the end of an article.  Sometimes the link will be followed by a number, which indicates the number trackbacks that link back to the blog."

Instead of moving the whole device, you simply roll the moveable ball on top of the trackball unit with your hand to generate motion input.\nTrackballs designed for computers generally serve as mouse replacements and are primarily used to move the cursor on the screen.  Like mice, computer trackball devices also include buttons, which can serve as left-click and right-click buttons, and may also be used to enter other commands.  While trackballs are most commonly used with computers, they may also be found in other electronics, such as arcade games, mixing boards, and self-serve kiosks.

Some advantages include the small footprint (since they don't require a mousepad or large area to move the mouse), fingertip control (which may offer more accuracy), and improved ergonomics (since there is less strain on the wrist).  Still, many people find trackballs harder to use than mice, since they feel less natural and may require practice to get used to.

Most typefaces (besides cursive ones) have a natural padding on the sides of each character.  The tracking setting adjusts this padding to be smaller or larger.\nA negative tracking setting can be used to fit more text in a specific area without reducing the font size.  Negative tracking allows more letters and numbers to be crammed into the same amount of horizontal space.  If the tracking setting is too low, however, the text may become difficult to read.  If it is reduced enough, the characters may overlap.\nA positive tracking setting can help make text more readable.  It may also be used for logos or other prominent text, since a high tracking setting makes text stand out more.  However, if the font tracking is too high, the text can actually become more difficult to read and spaces between words may be difficult to discern.\nTracking vs Kerning\nKerning is similar to tracking, but refers to spacing between specific letters.  Kerning allows certain letters to fit more closely without overlapping.  A good example is \"AV,\" in which kerning enables the lower part of the A to fit underneath the top part of the V.  Tracking does not consider individual character shapes, but simply adds uniform spacing between each character.\nNOTE: \"Tracking speed\" is unrelated to font tracking and describes the rate at which a mouse or trackpad moves the cursor.  A high tracking speed will make the cursor move further with less mouse movement or trackpad input."

Transistors are the building blocks of integrated circuits, such as computer processors, or CPUs.  Modern CPUs contain millions of individual transistors that are microscopic in size.\nMost transistors include three connection points, or terminals, which can connect to other transistors or electrical components.  By modifying the current between the first and second terminals, the current between the second and third terminals is changed.  This allows a transistor to act as a switch, which can turn a signal on or off.  Since computers operate in binary, and a transistor's \"on\" or \"off\" state can represent a 1 or 0, transistors are suitable for performing mathematical calculations.  A series of transistors may also be used as a logic gate when performing logical operations.\nTransistors in computer processors often turn signals on or off.  However, transistors can also change the amount of current being sent.  For example, an audio amplifier may contain a series of transistors that are used to increase the signal flow.  The increased signal generates an amplified sound output.  Because of their low cost and high reliability, transistors have mostly replaced vacuum tubes for sound amplification purposes.\nWhile early transistors were large enough to hold in your hand, modern transistors are so small they cannot be seen with the naked eye.  In fact, CPU transistors, such as those used in Intel's Ivy Bridge processor, are separated by a distance of 22 nanometers.  Considering one nanometer is one millionth of a millimeter, that is pretty small.  This microscopic size allows chip manufacturers to fit hundreds of millions of transistors into a single processor."

So one day, a few of the Greek soldiers brought the people of Troy a large wooden horse, which they accepted as a peace offering.  The horse was moved inside the city walls, where it sat until the night.  After the people of the city had fallen asleep, Greek soldiers jumped out of the wooden horse, opened the gates to let their fellow soldiers in, and took over the city.\nSo what is the moral of this story?  Mainly, beware of Trojan horses.  But how does that relate to computers?  That's a good question.  In the computing world, Trojan horses are more than just a myth.  They really exist and can cause damage to your computer.  Trojan horses are software programs that masquerade as regular programs, such as games, disk utilities, and even antivirus programs.  But if they are run, these programs can do malicious things to your computer.\nFor example, a Trojan horse might appear to be a computer game, but once you double-click it, the program starts writing over certain parts of your hard drive, corrupting your data.  While this is certainly something you want to avoid, it is good to know that these malicious programs are only dangerous if they are given a chance to run.  Also, most antivirus programs can catch Trojan horses when scanning for viruses.  Unlike viruses, however, Trojan horses don't replicate themselves.  Though it is possible for a Trojan horse to be attached to a virus file that spreads to multiple computers.\nSo as a general rule, don't open a program unless you know it is legitimate.  This applies especially to e-mail attachments that are executable files.  Even if you are pretty sure the attachment is OK, it is still a good idea to run it through your virus scan program (with the latest virus definitions) just to be safe.

Whatever the case, trolls are seen as a nuisance in online discussions.  At the least, their comments distract from an otherwise legitimate discourse.  In worse cases, trolls stir up emotions from other visitors, creating unnecessary arguments.\nThe action of posting obscene or inflammatory comments is often called \"trolling.\"  This activity is highly discouraged and may actually a violation of online community's user agreement.  Fortunately, webmasters and forum moderators typically have the power to remove offensive or off topic posts and even terminate accounts if needed.  While we enjoy the liberty of free speech online, it is still important to respect others.  Therefore, remember to show common courtesy when posting comments online and don't be a troll!"

            "Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing the source of a problem.  It is used to fix problems with hardware, software, and many other products.  The basic theory of troubleshooting is that you start with the most general (and often most obvious) possible problems, and then narrow it down to more specific issues.\nMany product manuals have a \"Troubleshooting\" section in the back of the manual.  This section contains a list of potential problems, which are often phrased in the form of a question.  For example, if your your computer's monitor is not producing an image, you may be asked to answer the following troubleshooting questions:\n\nIs the monitor plugged in to a power source?\nIs the monitor turned on?\nIs the monitor cable plugged into the computer?\nIs the computer turned on?\nIs the computer awake from sleep mode?\n\nIf the answers to all the above questions are Yes, there may be some additional questions such as:\n\nDoes your computer have a supporting video card?\nHave you installed the necessary video card drivers?\nIs the monitor resolution set properly?\n\nTypically, each of these questions will be followed by specific advise, whether the answer is Yes or No.  Sometimes, this advice is presented as a flowchart diagram.  This means each question is followed by a series of other questions, depending on the answer.  However, in many cases, only single solutions are provided for each question.\nTroubleshooting is something we all have to do at some point, though some of us have to troubleshoot product problems more often than others.  The good news is that, the more you do it, the more you learn and the better you get at fixing problems.  Since many products have similar troubleshooting steps, you may find that after awhile, you don't even need the manual to find solutions to the problems you encounter."

In computer science, the term is often used in reference to data types or variables, such as floating point numbers and strings.\nFor example, a function may truncate the decimal portion of a floating point number to make it an integer.  If the number 3.875 is truncated, it becomes 3.  Note that this is different than if the number had been rounded to the nearest integer, which would be 4.  Strings may also be truncated, which can be useful if a string exceeds the maximum character limit for a certain application.\nSeveral programming languages use the function trunc() to truncate a variable.  PHP uses strlen() to truncate a string to a set limit of characters."

Unlike traditional blogging websites, Tumblr encourages short posts, such as a single photo or a few sentences of text.  The goal is to make blogging quick and easy, enabling users to post frequent updates.\nTumblr is also more community-oriented than other blogging websites, offering a number of social features.  For example, you can follow other users, \"like\" specific posts, and \"reblog\" updates from other users.  The optional \"Reply\" and \"Ask\" features allow you to let other users comment on your blogs or ask questions.  There is also a Fan Mail feature that allows you to communicate privately with other bloggers.\nIf you want other Tumblr users to interact directly with one of your blogs, you can create a group blog.  When you add other users as members, they can post their own updates and reply to posts made by other members.  You can also promote members to admins, giving them permissions similar to a web forum moderator.  Admins can invite and remove users, delete posts, and view private messages.\nLike other social media websites, in order to use Tumblr, you first need to create an account.  After registering with your email address and choosing a username, Tumblr guides you through creating your first blog and following three others.  Once you've completed the initial steps, you can use the Tumblr dashboard to browse or search blogs and post your own updates."

            "The term \"tunneling\" probably brings to mind images of digging tunnels underground, perhaps for a subway system, or for you more technically-minded, a fiber optic cable connection.  In the virtual world of computers world, however, tunneling refers to a protocol in which one protocol is encapsulated within another.\nTunneling protocols are often used for establishing various types of connections over common protocols, such as HTTP.  For example, a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing program may mask data as HTTP to allow the data to be transferred through a firewall.  Since most firewalls allow HTTP (port 80) connections, the connection would likely be allowed, since this is the same port that the Web uses.  If the program used its own protocol and port number, the connection may be blocked.\nTunneling can also be used to establish secure connections through protocols that are typically not secure.  For example, the point-to-point tunneling protocol (PPTP) establishes a secure connection over a standard PPP connection, and can used to create a virtual private network (or VPN) between two remote locations.  PPTP allows a user to \"tunnel\" to another location with a secure password-protected connection using the standard or PPP protocol."

These elements may include integers, characters, strings, or other data types.\nMathematics\nThe term \"tuple\" originates from math, rather than computer science.  A math tuple may be defined as an \"n-tuple,\" where \"n\" is the number of values the tuple contains.  In mathematical expressions, tuples are represented by comma-delimited lists within parentheses.  The following example is a \"4-tuple,\" which has four values.\n(3, 7, 13, 17)\nTuples serve a variety of purposes in mathematics.  They are commonly used to represent a set of related values, such as prime numbers or mathematical sequences. A tuple can also display a range of input or output values for a function.\nComputer Science\nIn computer programming, tuples provide an efficient way to store multiple values.  Since they are static and cannot be modified, tuples generally require less memory than arrays.  They are also flexible since they can store multiple data types.  The following example is a \"5-tuple,\" or a tuple that contains five values.\n(11, 2020.07, \"techterms\", \"C\", -1000)\nThe \"pentuple\" above contains a positive integer (11), floating point number (2020.07), string (techterms), character (C), and a negative integer (-1000).\nTuples are an effective way to store data in computer programs, but not all programming languages support them.  For example, Python and Java support tuples, but PHP and Ruby do not.  If a language does not support tuples, an immutable array \u2014 one that cannot be modified \u2014 is the closest alternative."

Tutorials can be used for both school and business purposes and are written for basic, intermediate, and advanced users.  Even smart computer programmers use tutorials.  Most software development programs include a tutorial for creating a \"Hello World!\" program, which is the most basic program that can be created with the software.

However, the most popular type of content was online gaming, which led to the introduction of TwitchTV, a game streaming service, in 2011.  The platform gained several million users in the next few years and rebranded as simply \"Twitch.\"\nIn 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million.

Of course, in this era of limited attention spans, 140 characters may be as much as other users want to read anyway.  The character limit is also within the 160 character limit of SMS text messages.  This is useful, since tweets can be sent to Twitter using mobile phones.  To Twitter via your cell phone, you simply need to add your phone number in the \"Devices\" area of the Twitter Settings page.\nSince most people have frequent access to a computer or cell phone, Twitter makes it possible to provide others with frequent updates about your life.  Many people also use Twitter to blog about the news, politics, TV shows, or any other hot topic.  Some people even use it to share their thoughts on lectures or sermons.  So Twitter posts are certainly not limited to answering the question, \"What are you doing?\"\nTwitter has become the next hot trend in social networking.  While it is not as functional as Facebook or MySpace, Twitter's appeal lies within its simplicity.  It allows friends, family, and complete strangers to stay connected through quick updates that only take a couple of seconds to write.  Therefore, if you like to feel connected to others, but have limited time, Twitter might just be for you.\nWhile \"Twitter\" is a noun, in can also be used as a verb.

For example, if someone knows your email address and guesses your password, he or she may be able to access your account.  Two-factor authentication adds another layer of security that protects your account even if someone finds out your login information.\nBelow are several types of two-factor authentication:\n\nA four to six-digit code sent via text message to the user's mobile phone\nA one-time code sent via email to the user's email address\nAn additional PIN or passcode required in addition to a username and password\nA secret question and answer created by the user\nA physical token, such as a small \"key\" that displays dynamic code\nA hardwired dongle linked to the user's account\nA biometric identifier such as a fingerprint or facial recognition.\n\nIn many cases, two-factor authentication is only required once per device.  After you have successfully logged into a website on a specific device, the site may set a cookie in your browser.  Once this cookie is set, your device becomes the secondary authentication for future logins.\nIn order to bypass two-factor authentication each time you log in to a website, you may need to check the \"Remember this device\" checkbox when logging in.\nSome websites and online services offer two-factor authentication as an optional security feature, while others require it.  2FA options are typically located in the \"Password & Security\" settings within a user account."

            "Typecasting, or type conversion, is a method of changing an entity from one data type to another.  It is used in computer programming to ensure variables are correctly processed by a function.\nAn example of typecasting is converting an integer to a string.  This might be done in order to compare two numbers, when one number is saved as a string and the other is an integer.  For example, a mail program might compare the first part of a street address with an integer.  If the integer \"123\" is compared with the string \"123\" the result might be false.  If the integer is first converted to a string, then compared with the number in the street address, it will return true.\nAnother common typecast is converting a floating point number to an integer.  This might be used to perform calculations more efficiently when the decimal precision is unnecessary.  However, it is important to note that when typecasting a floating point number to an integer, many programming languages simply truncate the decimal value.  This is demonstrated in the C++ function below.\nint float_to_int(float a) &nbsp; \/\/ example: a = 2.75\n{\n&nbsp; &nbsp; int b = (int)a; &nbsp; \/\/ typecast float to int\n&nbsp; &nbsp; return b; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \/\/ returns 2\n}\nIn order to round to the nearest value, adding 0.5 to the floating point number and then typecasting it to an integer will produce an accurate result.  For example, in the function below, both 2.75 and 3.25 will get rounded to 3.\nint round_float_to_int(float a) &nbsp; \/\/ example: a = 2.75\n{\n&nbsp; &nbsp; int b = (int)(a+0.5); &nbsp; \/\/ typecast float to int after adding 0.5\n&nbsp; &nbsp; return b; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \/\/ returns 3\n}\nWhile most high-level programming languages support typecasting, each language uses its own method to convert data.  Therefore, it is important to understand how the language converts between data types when typecasting variables."
