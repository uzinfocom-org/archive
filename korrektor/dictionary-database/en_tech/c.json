Since then, C# has gone through several revisions, corresponding with each .NET update.  Today, it is one of the most popular programming languages for creating Windows programs and web applications.\nC# is a derivative of the C programming language and is similar to C++.  It uses the same basic operators as C++, is object oriented, case sensitive, and has nearly identical syntax.  However, there are several differences between C# and C++.  Below are just a few examples:\n\nArrays in C++ are pointers, while in C#, they are objects that may include methods and properties.\nThe bool (boolean) data type is not recognized as an integer as it is in C++.\nThe keywords typedef, extern, and static all have different meanings in C# than they do in C++.\nC# switch statements do not support fall-through from one case to another.\nGlobal methods and variables are not supported in C#, while they are in C++.\n\nMost importantly, C# is designed specifically for Microsoft's .NET Framework.  This allows developers to take advantage of all the features offered by the .NET API.  However, it also means C# applications can only run on platforms that support .NET runtime, such as Windows, Windows Server, and Windows Phone.  In order for programs written in C# to run on other platforms, the code must be compiled using a conversion tool like Microsoft .NET Native.\nNOTE: The name \"C#\" comes from the musical note \"C\u266f,\" implying it is a step up from the original version of C.  The \u266f symbol is also comprised of four plus signs, which may imply C# is more advanced than C++ as well."

For example, architects may use CAD software to create overhead views of building floor plans and outdoor landscapes.  These layouts, which contain vector graphics, can be scaled to different sizes, which may be used for proposals or blueprints.  2D CAD also includes drawings, such as sketches and mockups, which are common at the beginning of the design process.\n3D CAD is commonly used in developing video games and animated films.  It also has several real-world applications, such as product design, civil engineering, and simulation modeling.  3D CAD includes computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), which involves the actual manufacturing of three-dimensional objects.   \nLike 2D CAD drawings, 3D models are typically vector-based, but the vectors include three dimensions, rather than two.  This allows designers to create complex 3D shapes that can be moved, rotated, enlarged, and modified.  Some 3D models are created exclusively of polygons, while others may include B\u00e9zier curves and other rounded surfaces.\nWhen creating a 3D model, a CAD designer may first construct the basic shape of the object, or \"wireframe.\"  Once the shape is complete, surfaces can be added that may include colors, gradients, or designs that can be applied using a process called texture mapping.  Many CAD programs include the ability to adjust lighting, which affects the shadows and reflections of the object.  Some programs also include a timeline that can be used to create 3D animations."

The result is a larger photo with more detail.\nCCDs in video cameras are usually measured by physical size.  For example, most consumer digital cameras use a CCD around 1\/6 or 1\/5 of an inch in size.  More expensive cameras may have CCDs 1\/3 of an inch in size or larger.  The larger the sensor, the more light it can capture, meaning it will produce better video in low light settings.

The CD standard was proposed by Sony and Philips in 1980 and the technology was introduced to the U.S. market in 1983.  CDs can hold up to 700 MB of data or 80 minutes of audio.  The data on a CD is stored as small notches on the disc and is read by a laser from an optical drive.  The drives translate the notches (which represent 1's and 0's) into usable data.\nThe first CDs were audio CDs, which eventually replaced audio tapes (which earlier replaced records).  Audio CDs have the advantage of allowing the user to jump to different places on the disc.  CDs can also be listened to an unlimited number of times without losing quality.  Audio tapes can start to lose quality after listening to them as few as ten times.  This is because the laser that reads the data on a CD doesn't put pressure on the disc, whereas the playheads on a tape deck slowly wear away the magnetic strip on the tape.\nIn 1985, CD-ROMs hit the computer market.  Because they could store far more information than floppy discs (700 MB compared to 1.4 MB), CDs soon became the most common software format.  In 1988, the CD-R (CD-Recordable) technology was introduced, allowing computer users to burn their own CDs.  However, this technology did not become mainstream until the late 1990s.  A smaller 3\" CD, called \"CD-3\" is also available and is readable by most tray-loading CD-ROM drives."

This is accomplished using data replication, which stores the same data on multiple servers.  Whenever you access a website hosted on a CDN, the network will intelligently provide you with the content using the server closest to the your geographical location.\nBy providing Internet-based content over a CDN, large businesses can avoid bottlenecks associated with serving data from a single location.

A home theater system may include multiple power cables, as well as A\/V cables for HDMI and analog audio connections.  The resulting pile of cables, if not managed properly, can easily become a tangled mess.\nCable management offers several benefits:\n\nIt provides a cleaner workspace or living area.\nIt makes it easier to add or remove devices and cables.\nIt protects cables from crimping or other damage.\nIt prevents cables from disconnecting unexpectedly.\nIt limits interference from other cables.\n\nCable management may be as simple as a tying a few cables together with adjustable cable clips.

This type of organization requires choosing the right cable length and correct cable management sleeves so that cables can be easily added or removed.\nRegardless of the application, cable management is an important part of any electronic setup.

Some cable modems even include a built-in wireless router, eliminating the need for a second device.\nNOTE: While \"cable modem\" includes the word \"modem,\" it does not function as a traditional modem (which is short for \"modulator\/demodulator\").

            "Cache, which is pronounced \"cash\" (not \"catch\" or \"cashay\"), stores recently used information so that it can be quickly accessed at a later time.  Computers incorporate several different types of caching in order to run more efficiently, thereby improving performance.  Common types of caches include browser cache, disk cache, memory cache, and processor cache.\n\nBrowser cache - Most web browsers cache webpage data by default.  For example, when you visit a webpage, the browser may cache the HTML, images, and any CSS or JavaScript files referenced by the page.  When you browse through other pages on the site that use the same images, CSS, or JavaScript, your browser will not have to re-download the files.  Instead, the browser can simply load them from the cache, which is stored on your local hard drive.\nMemory cache - When an application is running, it may cache certain data in the system memory, or RAM.  For example, if you are working on a video project, the video editor may load specific video clips and audio tracks from the hard drive into RAM.  Since RAM can be accessed much more quickly than a hard drive, this reduces lag when importing and editing files.\nDisk cache - Most HDDs and SSDs include a small amount of RAM that serves as a disk cache.  A typical disk cache for a 1 terabyte hard drive is 32 megabytes, while a 2 TB hard drive may have a 64 MB cache.  This small amount of RAM can make a big difference in the drive's performance.  For example, when you open a folder with a large number of files, the references to the files may be automatically saved in the disk cache.  The next time you open the folder, the list of files may load instantly instead of taking several seconds to appears.\nProcessor cache - Processor caches are even smaller than disk caches.  This is because a processor cache contains tiny blocks of data, such as frequently used instructions, that can be accessed quickly by the CPU.  Modern processors often contain an L1 cache that is right next to the processor and an L2 cache that is slightly further away.  The L1 cache is the smallest (around 64 KB), while the L2 cache may be around 2 MB in size.  Some high-end processors even include an L3 cache, which is larger than the L2 cache.  When a processor accesses data from a higher-level cache, it may also move the data to the lower-level cache for faster access next time.\n\nMost caching is done in the background, so you won't even notice it is happening.  In fact, the only one of the above caches that you can control is the browser cache.  You can open your browser preferences to view the cache settings and alter the size of your browser cache or empty the cache if needed."

The raw files are unprocessed, allowing the photographer to adjust settings like exposure, white balance, and saturation after the image has been captured.  Instead of applying lossy JPEG compression, which reduces the image quality, RAW mode saves files in a losslessly compressed format.\nBecause Camera RAW files are uncompressed, they take up more space than typical JPEG images.  In fact, RAW files often require 5 to 10 times more disk space for each image captured.  So you'll want to have a large memory card in your camera if you plan on shooting in RAW mode.\nViewing Camera RAW Files\nSince Camera RAW files are not saved in a standard image format, image viewing programs may not recognize them.  Even if a program supports the Canon RAW format, it may not recognize a RAW file saved by a newly released Canon camera.

Technically speaking, Cat 5e cables must adhere to stricter IEEE standards in regards to Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT) measurements, which are measured in decibels.\nThe difference between Cat 5 and Cat 5e shielding is specific to the internal wires, not the outer sleeve, or \"jacket.\"  An Ethernet cable's outer jacket (designed for indoor, outdoor, in-wall, etc) has no bearing on the IEEE rating.\nIn 2001, Cat 5e began to replace Cat 5 as the most widely used Ethernet cable standard.  Today, nearly all wired networks use Cat 5e cables or higher."

            "Cat 6 (short for \"Category 6\") is an Ethernet standard.  It operates at 250 MHz and supports data transfer rates of 10 Gbps.  The maximum speed of Cat 6 is 10x faster than the previous standard, Cat 5e.\nFrom the outside, Cat 6 cables look identical to Cat 5 and Cat 5e cables.  They use the same RJ45 connectors and are backward-compatible with Cat 5\/5e Ethernet networks.  Internally, Cat 6 cables retain the same \"twisted pair\" wiring scheme with eight internal wires.  The primary difference between Cat 6 and Cat 5 is that Cat 6 operates at 250 MHz, while Cat 5 and 5e operate at 100 MHz.  The higher frequency enables Cat 6 cables to transfer data more quickly.\nCat 6 vs Cat 6a\nSimilar to Cat 5, Cat 6 has a variant with performance improvements.  The variant is called Cat 6a (rather than Cat 6e).  Cat 6a operates at 500 MHz, twice the frequency of Cat 6, but supports the same maximum data transfer rate of 10 Gbps.  The difference is that Cat 6 can only transmit data at 10 Gbps for 55 meters (180 feet), while Cat 6a supports 10 Gbps for 100 meters (328 feet).  A Cat 6 cable will still work over 55 meters, but the speed may decline.\nIn order for Ethernet cables to transfer data at full speed over long distances, a router or powered signal booster must be placed every 100 meters.\nWhile Cat 5e was the most popular Ethernet standard for nearly two decades, many modern LANs now use Cat 6 or Cat 6a cables.  Even if the network equipment does not support 10 Gbps transfer speeds, Cat 6 cable is necessary to transfer data over 1 Gbps.  Cat 6 cables are usually more expensive than Cat 5\/5e cables, but re-running new Ethernet lines can be time-consuming and costly.  Therefore, it is typically worth the extra expense to future-proof a network with faster Ethernet cables.\nNOTE: Most Ethernet cables have the type of standard printed on the outer jacket."

Notably, Catalina is the first version of macOS to drop 32-bit support.  By removing support for 32-bit applications, Apple trimmed a significant amount of \"legacy\" code from the OS.  The result is a lighter-weight operating system optimized for 64-bit applications.\nWhile most modern apps are 64-bit, older 32-bit apps will not run in macOS 10.15.\nCatalina is also the first version of macOS that allows an iPad to serve as a secondary display.  This feature, called \"Sidecar,\" works with both a wired and wireless connection between a Mac and an iPad.  It also introduces \"Project Catalyst,\" which makes it possible for iOS and iPadOS apps to run on macOS.\nMost of Catalina's other new features are related to the bundled apps.  For example, iTunes is replaced by three new apps: Music, Podcast, and TV.  Mail adds message blocking and built-in unsubscribing.  The Reminders app provides a new way to organize and manage reminders.  Catalina also includes Screen Time, a feature introduced in iOS 12.  It allows users to track how much time they spend on their computers, including how much they use individual apps."

If you want to send the message to one or more other recipients, you can use the \"Cc:\" field to add additional addresses.  This will send the e-mail to the address in the \"To:\" field and to each address listed in the \"Cc:\" field as well.\nThe \"Cc:\" option is often used in business communications when a message is intended for one person, but is relevant to other people as well.  For example, a retail employee may e-mail another employee saying he can work for her on a certain day.  He might include his manager's and assistant manager's e-mail addresses in the \"Cc:\" field to let them know he is taking the work shift.

Since most spreadsheets use numbers to define rows and letters to define columns, cells are often referenced by a letter and number combination.\nFor example, the cell A3 is located in the first column (A), in the third row of a spreadsheet.  The cell B3 would be immediately to the right of A3 and the cell A4 would be directly below it.  These examples are relative cell references, since they are based on the actual names of the cells.  If a user changed the name of column A to \"Income\" and the name of row 3 to \"Q3,\" the reference would be \"IncomeQ3\" instead of A3.  However, you could also refer to the cell by the absolute cell reference, which is defined by $A$3.  Many spreadsheet programs support absolute cell references, which are useful when creating formulas.\nCells may contain several data types, including numbers, dates, times, currencies, percentages, text, and other types of data.  Most spreadsheet programs allow you to format cells for different data types, which helps ensure uniform entries across multiple cells.  For example, you could format the active cell (or currently selected cell) to US dollar currency.  If you enter \"123\" in the cell, it may automatically change to \"$123.00\" when you press Tab or Enter or click outside the cell.  If the active cell is formatted for a date, the text \"1\/2\/3\" may change to \"01\/02\/2003.\"\nCells may contain manually entered data or the results of calculations from other cells.  For example, cell A20 may contain a formula that produces the result of the summation of cells A1-A15.  Cell C5 may contain a formula that averages all the numbers in the B column.

For example, a cell may contain the function:\n=D8\/E10\nThe above function will automatically populate the cell with the value stored in cell D8 divided by the value in E10.  If G2 contains the function above, and D8 is 20 and E10 is 5, then G2 will display the value 4.  A cell may also simply display the value of another cell.

In order to accomplish this, the text is saved using one of several types of character encoding.\nThe most popular types of character encoding are ASCII and Unicode.  While ASCII is still supported by nearly all text editors, Unicode is more commonly used because it supports a larger character set.  Unicode is often defined as UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32, which refer to different Unicode standards.  UTF stands for \"Unicode Transformation Format\" and the number indicates the number of bits used to represent each character.  From the early days of computing, characters have been represented by at least one byte (8 bits), which is why the different Unicode standards save characters in multiples of 8 bits.\nWhile ASCII and Unicode are the most common types of character encoding, other encoding standards may also be used to encode text files.  For example, several types of language-specific character encoding standards exist, such as Western, Latin-US, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.  While Western languages use similar characters, Eastern languages require a completely different character set.  Therefore, a Latin encoding would not support the symbols needed to represent a text string in Chinese.

Checksums are typically used to compare two sets of data to make sure they are the same.  Some common applications include verifying a disk image or checking the integrity of a downloaded file.  If the checksums don't match those of the original files, the data may have been altered or corrupted.\nA checksum can be computed in many different ways, using different algorithms.  For example, a basic checksum may simply be the number of bytes in a file.  However, this type of checksum is not very reliable since two or more bytes could be switched around, causing the data to be different, though the checksum would be the same.  Therefore, more advanced checksum algorithms are typically used to verify data.  These include cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithms and cryptographic hash functions.\nIt is rare that you will need to use a checksum to verify data, since many programs perform this type of data verification automatically.  However, some file archives or disk images may include a checksum that you can use to check the data's integrity.  While it is not always necessary to verify data, it can be a useful means for checking large amounts of data at once.  For example, after burning a disc, it is much easier to verify that the checksums of the original data and the disc match, rather than checking every folder and file on the disc.\nBoth Mac and Windows include free programs that can be used to generate and verify checksums.

While the syntax of a class definition varies between programming languages, classes serve the same purpose in each language.  All classes may contain variable definitions and methods, or subroutines that can be run by the corresponding object.\nBelow is an example of a basic Java class definition:\nclass Sample\n{\n&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main(String[] args)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; String sampleText = \"Hello world!\";\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(sampleText);\n&nbsp;&nbsp; }\n}\nThe above class, named Sample, includes a single method named main.  Within main, the variable sampleText is defined as \"Hello world!\"  The main method invokes the System class from Java's built-in core library, which contains the out.println method.  This method is used to print the sample text to the text output window.\nClasses are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming.  They allow variables and methods to be isolated to specific objects instead of being accessible by all parts of the program.  This encapsulation of data protects each class from changes in other parts of the program.  By using classes, developers can create structured programs with source code that can be easily modified.\nNOTE: While classes are foundational in object-oriented programming, they serve as blueprints, rather than the building blocks of each program.  This is because classes must be instantiated as objects in order to be used within a program.  Constructors are typically used to create objects from classes, while destructors are used to free up resources used by objects that are no longer needed."

However, sometimes an OS upgrade is not possible because important files have become lost or corrupted.  In this case, a clean install may be the only option.

Additionally, a clean install may be appropriate when installing an OS on a new hard drive or when transferring ownership of a computer to another person.\nBoth Windows and Mac OS X allow you to perform a clean install when upgrading your operating system.  The installer will give you the choice between a standard upgrade (typically the default option) and a clean installation near the beginning of the installation process.  Windows 7 also lets you format and partition your installation disk if you select a clean install.  In Mac OS X, you can use the Disk Utility program to format or partition your drive before you perform the clean install.\nNOTE: Since a clean install wipes out all data on the primary hard disk, it is crucial to back up your data before performing the installation.  While it is wise to make sure you have a recent backup of your data before any OS upgrade, it is extremely important when performing a clean install.  Backing up your data to an external hard drive or another computer are both good options.

Most servers have a one-to-many relationship with clients, meaning a single server can provide resources to multiple clients at one time.\nWhen a client requests a connection to a server, the server can either accept or reject the connection.  If the connection is accepted, the server establishes and maintains a connection with the client over a specific protocol.  For example, an email client may request an SMTP connection to a mail server in order to send a message.  The SMTP application on the mail server will then request authentication from the client, such as the email address and password.  If these credentials match an account on the mail server, the server will send the email to the intended recipient.\nOnline multiplayer gaming also uses the client-server model.  One example is Blizzard's Battle.net service, which hosts online games for World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Overwatch, and others.  When players open a Blizzard application, the game client automatically connects to a Battle.net server.  Once players log in to Battle.net, they can see who else is online, chat with other players, and play matches with or against other gamers.\nWhile Internet servers typically provide connections to multiple clients at a time, each physical machine can only handle so much traffic.  Therefore, popular online services distribute clients across multiple physical servers, using a technique called distributed computing.  In most cases, it does not matter which specific machine users are connected to, since the servers all provide the same service.\nNOTE: The client-server model may be contrasted to the P2P model, in which clients connect directly to each other.  In a P2P connection, there is no central server required, since each machine acts as both a client and a server."

For example, a picture of a female teacher in a classroom may have the keywords \"school,\" \"teacher,\" \"woman,\" \"classroom,\" and \"students\" associated with it.  Most clip art programs allow you to search for images based on these keywords.\nWhen you find a clip art image you want to use, you can copy it to your computer's clipboard and paste it into another program, such as Photoshop or Microsoft Word.  You may also be able to export the image to the Desktop or another folder on your hard disk.  Most clip art is royalty free, meaning you can use the images without paying royalties to the creators of the images.  So if you buy a clip art package with 50,000 images for $50.00, you are only paying 1\/10 of one cent for each image.  That's a pretty good deal."

            "A clock cycle, or simply a \"cycle,\" is a single electronic pulse of a CPU.  During each cycle, a CPU can perform a basic operation such as fetching an instruction, accessing memory, or writing data.  Since only simple commands can be performed during each cycle, most CPU processes require multiple clock cycles.\nIn physics, the frequency of a signal is determined by cycles per second, or \"hertz.\"  Similarly, the frequency of a processor is measured in clock cycles per second.  Since modern processors can complete millions of clock cycles every second, processor speeds are often measured in megahertz or gigahertz.\nThe frequency of a processor is also known as the processor's clock speed.  While the clock speed is important in determining the processor's overall performance, it is not the only factor.  Since processors have different instruction sets, they may differ in the number of cycles needed to complete each instruction, or CPI (cycles per instruction).  Therefore, some processors can perform faster than others, even at slower clock speeds."

            "Clock speed is the rate at which a processor can complete a processing cycle.  It is typically measured in megahertz or gigahertz.  One megahertz is equal to one million cycles per second, while one gigahertz equals one billion cycles per second.  This means a 1.8 GHz processor has twice the clock speed of a 900 MHz processor.\nHowever, it is important to note that a 1.8 GHz CPU is not necessarily twice as fast as a 900 MHz CPU.  This is because different processors often use different architectures.  For example, one processor may require more clock cycles to complete a multiplication instruction than another processor.  If the 1.8 GHz CPU can complete a multiplication instruction in 4 cycles, while the 900 MHz CPU takes 6 cycles, the 1.8 GHz processor will perform the operation more than twice as fast as the 900 MHz processor.  Conversely, if the 1.8 GHz processor takes more cycles to perform the same instruction, it will be less than 2x as fast as the 900 MHz processor.\nOther factors also contribute to the overall performance of a computer.  Examples include the number of processors, the bus speed, cache size, speed of the RAM, and HDD or SSD speed.  Therefore, while the processor's clock speed is a significant indicator of how fast a computer is, it is not the only factor that matters."

A cluster, or allocation unit, is a group of sectors that make up the smallest unit of disk allocation for a file within a file system.  In other words, a file system's cluster size is the smallest amount of space a file can take up on a computer.\nA common sector size is 512 bytes.  A common cluster size is 8 sectors.  Therefore, many file systems have a minimum cluster size of 4 kibibytes (8 x 512 bytes).\nMost files require a large number of clusters, which means the file contents are spread across multiple clusters on the drive.  Often the data can be written in contiguous blocks so that the file contents are stored in one physical location.  However, when a hard drive begins to fill up, there may not be enough contiguous clusters available to save large files in a single area.  Instead, they must be written in multiple locations on the disk.  This is called fragmentation and can slow down the hard drive's read and write speeds.\n2) A group of connected computers\nA cluster can also refer to a group of machines that work together that perform a similar function.  Unlike grid computing, a computer cluster is controlled by a single software program that manages all the computers or \"nodes\" within the cluster.  The nodes work together to complete a single task.  This process is called \"parallel computing\" since the nodes perform operations in tandem.\nComputer clusters can range from two machines to hundreds of connected computers.  Small clusters are often used to improve the performance of web and online gaming services by handling multiple incoming requests in parallel.  A web farm, for example, is a type of cluster that provides low latency access to websites.  Large clusters can be used to perform scientific calculations or to run a large number of complex algorithms.

While coax cables have many applications, they are most commonly used to transmit cable TV and Internet signals.\nCoax cables that run underground are typically thicker and more heavily insulated than the cables that connect your cable box or cable modem to the wall outlet.  However, they all transmit data via a thin copper line in the middle of the cable.  This wire is surrounded by a layer of insulation comprised of non-conductive or \u201cdielectric\u201d material.  The dielectric layer is covered with one or more metallic shields that provides additional protection from signal interference.  Finally, a protective plastic outer layer surrounds the entire cable.\nThe heavy duty design of coaxial cables is what allows them to carry data over long distances with minimum signal degradation.  In many cases, coax cables laid by cable companies several decades ago are sufficient to provide HDTV and high-speed Internet access simultaneously.  However, certain coax cables (such as RG-59 cables) are designed for low bandwidth applications, like connecting a VCR to a TV, and may not provide enough bandwidth to carry a full HDTV signal.

However, most codecs do compress the original data, reducing the size of the original file.  This is important for multimedia files, since they often have large file sizes.  Compressed files take up less disk space and can be downloaded more quickly.\nGenerally, a codec reduces the file size of a media file, but increases the processing power required to play the file back correctly.\nLossless vs Lossy Codecs\nSome codecs are lossless, meaning they do not reduce the quality of the original media file.  Examples of lossless audio codecs include the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), and the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC).  Video codecs that support lossless compression include H.264 and QuickTime RLE.  A lossless codec can often reduce the file size of a media file to about 50% without altering the quality.\nOther codecs are lossy, meaning the compression reduces the quality of the media.  Examples of lossy audio codecs are Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) and MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3).  Common lossy video codecs include MPEG-2 and HEVC.  Most lossy codecs provide a variable compression setting, which allows you to select how much to compress the media.  For example, if you apply heavy compression to an audio file, it may reduce the file size to 10%, but the audio may sound like it has been compressed.  If you use a lower compression setting that reduces the file size to 30%, it may be closer to the original file.\nNOTE: Lossy codecs are commonly applied to streaming media so the data can be transferred more quickly over the Internet."

The other is specific to networking and happens when two devices transmit data at the same time.\n1. Data Collision\nA data collision may take place when hashing data or when calculating a checksum.  A hash function reduces data to a smaller value and is often used in compression and cryptography.  While the hash operation may save disk space, it is possible that two different inputs may produce the same output.  Multiple hash functions can be used to avoid duplicate values when a collision occurs.\nSimilarly, checksums are not guaranteed to be unique since they are smaller than the original data.  While the probability is often very low, two different data sets can theoretically produce the same checksum value.  A well-designed algorithm should minimize this risk.\n2. Network Collision\nA network collision occurs when two or more devices attempt to transmit data over a network at the same time.  For example, if two computers on an Ethernet network send data at the same moment, the data will \"collide\" and not finish transmitting.  This is why most networking protocols confirm that packets has been received before transmitting additional data.\nSwitches and routers can reduce collisions by checking if a transmission line is idle or \"in use\" before transmitting data.  A common method is CSMA\/CD or \"Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance.\"  While it is possible to reduce collisions, they cannot be completely avoided.  For example, if two systems determine a line is idle and then transmit data at exactly the same time, a collision may occur.  This can be resolved by retransmitting the data after a random delay."

Most image viewers and media playback programs can open standard compressed file types directly.\nFile compression is always performed using a lossless compression algorithm, meaning no information is lost during the compression process.  Therefore, a compressed archive can be fully restored to the original version when it is decompressed.  While some media is compressed using lossless compression, most image, audio, and video files are compressed using lossy compression.  This means some of the media's original quality is lost when the file is compressed.  However, most modern compression algorithms can compress media with little to no loss in quality."

Containers are not installed like traditional software programs, which allows them to be isolated from the other software and the operating system itself.\nThe isolated nature of containers provides several benefits.  First, the software in a container will run the same in different environments.  For example, a container that includes PHP and MySQL can run identically on both a Linux computer and a Windows machine.  Second, containers provide added security since the software will not affect the host operating system.  While an installed application may alter system settings and modify resources, such as the Windows registry, a container can only modify settings within the container.  This makes containers ideal for software testing and development.\nContainers also eliminate installation issues, including system conflicts, version incompatibilities, and missing dependencies.  The result is a \"works on all machines\" solution, which is ideal for both developers and end users.  It also makes the jobs of network administrators easier, since they can deliver containers to a multiple users without having to worry about compatibility issues.\nContainers vs Virtual Machines\nContainers are similar to virtual machines (virtualization) since they include everything needed to run in a single package.  However, unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers do not include a guest OS.  Instead containers run on top of a \"container platform,\" like Docker, which is installed on an operating system.

For example, if you right-click on your computer's desktop, the menu that appears will have desktop-specific commands.  These may include options to change the desktop background, create a new folder, clean up the icons, or view the desktop properties.  If you right-click within a desktop window, you might see options to create a new folder, change the view options, or view the folder properties.\nRight-clicking within an application typically provides menu options that are specific to the current program.  For example, if you right-click in a Web browser window, the menu that appears may include options such as \"Back,\" \"Reload,\" and \"Print.\"  Right-clicking a misspelled word in a word processing program often presents a list of similar correctly spelled words.

The length of copyright protection may vary from country to country, but it usually lasts for the life of the author plus 50 to 100 years.\nMany different types of content can be protected by copyright.  Examples include books, poems, plays, songs, films, and artwork.  In modern times, copyright protection has been extended to websites and other online content.  Therefore, any original content published on the Web is protected by copyright law.  This is important in the digital age we live in, since large amounts of content can be easily copied and pasted.\nSo how do you obtain copyright protection?  Fortunately, in most countries, copyright protection is automatic.  This means whenever you publish original content, it is automatically protected by copyright law.  For example, if you post a blog on the Internet, your content is automatically covered by copyright.  In most cases, this type of copyright protection is all that is necessary.  However, if you want others to know your content is copyright protected, you can post the copyright logo (&copy;) next to your name on any Web pages that include your original content.  You may also want to include the years you have owned the content.  Below is an example of a copyright line:\nCopyright &copy; 2007-2009 [your name].\nIn situations where it is critical to protect an author's rights, many countries provide copyright registration, which allows authors to register copyrighted content with a central agency.  This makes it easier to prove ownership of content if it is ever disputed.\nCopyright provides a helpful means of protecting original content.  It serves to give people credit for the work they do, which is something we can all appreciate.  Therefore, if you ever consider copying someone else's content, think of how it would make you feel if someone copied your original work and published it as their own.

If you are copying or downloading a file, the crash may produce a corrupt file.  In some cases, a crash can even cause errors in the file system of your storage device.\nSince crashes create a negative user experience, software developers aim to create stable programs that do not crash.

Some programs are even designed to handle crashes gracefully, generating detailed error messages if a \"fatal error\" occurs.  Many productivity applications save your work periodically so you can recover your work after a crash.\nWith older computers (before the turn of the century), when a program crashed, it often took down the whole system with it.  This made restarting the computer a frequent task.  Modern operating systems support multi-threading, which enables programs to run independently of each other.

While most browsers are similar in both design and function, they often have several small differences in the way they recognize and display websites.  For example, Apple's Safari uses a different HTML rendering engines than Internet Explorer.  This means the browsers may display the same Web page with slightly different page and text formatting.  Since not all browsers support the same HTML tags, some formatting may not be recognized at all in an incompatible Web browser.  Furthermore, browsers interpret JavaScript code differently, which means a script may work fine in one browser, but not in another.\nBecause of the differences in the way Web browsers interpret HTML and JavaScript, Web developers must test and adapt their sites to work with multiple browsers.  For example, if a certain page looks fine in Firefox, but does not show up correctly in Internet Explorer,  the developer may change the formatting so that it works with Internet Explorer.  Of course, the page may then appear differently in Firefox.  The easiest fix for browser incompatibility problems is to use a more basic coding technique that works in both browsers.  However, if this solution is not possible, the developer may need to add code that detects the type of browser, then outputs custom HTML or JavaScript for that browser.\nMaking a cross-browser site is usually pretty simple for basic websites.  However, complex sites with a lot of HTML formatting and JavaScript may require significant extra coding in order to be compatible with multiple browsers.  Some developers may even generate completely different pages for each browser.

Therefore, modern cryptography involves developing encryption methods that are difficult for even supercomputers to break."

            "The cursor on your screen can indicate two things: 1) where your mouse pointer is, or 2) where the next character typed will be entered in a line of text.\nThe mouse cursor is most often an arrow that you can use to point to different objects on your screen.  When the cursor is over an object, you can click or double-click the mouse button to perform an action on that object (such as opening a program).  The mouse cursor can change into other images, such as a small hand (when you roll over a link in a Web page), or an hourglass (when Windows is \"thinking\" so hard, it won't let you click on anything).\nThe text cursor is typically a straight vertical line or I-shaped object that flashes in a line of text.  Typically, when you are typing a paper, the cursor will be at the end of the line, because you are adding new text to the uncharted white area of the page.  However, if you want to insert a word or phrase somewhere else in a line of text, you can use the mouse cursor to click the position where you would like to insert the text.  In most word processing programs, once you start typing, the text cursor continues to flash, but the mouse pointer disappears until you move the mouse again.  This is to avoid \"cursor confusion,\" since most people can't type and click on things at the same time."

            "Cut is a command that allows you to \"cut out\" a selection of text or other data and save it to the clipboard.  It is similar to the Copy command, but instead of just copying the data to the clipboard, it removes the selected data at the same time.  For example, if you highlight a sentence in a word processing program and select \"Cut,\" the sentence is removed from the document and is added to the clipboard.  Therefore, selecting \"Cut\" is an simple way to both copy and delete a selection in a single step.\nObjects that can be cut include text, images, audio and video segments, and other types of data.  However, you may notice that some selections can only be copied and not cut.  This is typically because the object is not editable and therefore can only be copied.  If you cut a selection from a document, it can be pasted into another similar document.  However, if you copy something else to the clipboard before pasting the selection, the cut data may be lost.\nLike the Copy and Paste commands, the Cut command is located in the Edit menu of most programs.  The standard shortcut for \"Cut\" is Control-X in Windows and Command-X in Mac OS X.  (If you're wondering why it isn't the \"C\" key, that shortcut is reserved for the Copy command.)  Therefore, you can tell if a program supports the Cut command by clicking the Edit menu and looking for the Cut command."

            "There are bullies and then there are cyberbullies.  While bullying typically happens at school or work, cyberbullying takes place over cyberspace.  This includes both Internet and cell phone communication.  Like physical bullying, cyberbullying is aimed at younger people, such as children and teenagers.  It may involve harassing, threatening, embarrassing, or humiliating young people online.\nCyberbullying can take many forms.  The following are just a few examples:\n\nMaking fun of another user in an Internet chat room.\nHarassing a user over an instant messaging session.\nPosting derogatory messages on a user's Facebook or MySpace page.\nCirculating false rumors about someone on social networking websites.\nPublishing lewd comments about another person on a personal blog.\nPosting unflattering pictures of another user on the Web.\nSpamming another user with unwanted e-mail messages.\nSending threatening or provocative e-mails.\nRepeatedly calling another person's cell phone.\nSending unsolicited text messages to another user.\n\nCyberbullying may seem humorous to some people, but it is a serious matter.  Kids who are bullied online often feel hurt and rejected by their peers.  This can lead to low self esteem and depression.  Therefore, cyberbullying should not be tolerated and should be reported to authorities.\nNOTE: Technically, cyberbullying takes place between two young people.  When adults are involved, it may be called cyber-harassment or cyberstalking."

            "Cybercrime is criminal activity done using computers and the Internet.  This includes anything from downloading illegal music files to stealing millions of dollars from online bank accounts.  Cybercrime also includes non-monetary offenses, such as creating and distributing viruses on other computers or posting confidential business information on the Internet.\nPerhaps the most prominent form of cybercrime is identity theft, in which criminals use the Internet to steal personal information from other users.  Two of the most common ways this is done is through phishing and pharming.  Both of these methods lure users to fake websites (that appear to be legitimate), where they are asked to enter personal information.  This includes login information, such as usernames and passwords, phone numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and other information criminals can use to \"steal\" another person's identity.  For this reason, it is smart to always check the URL or Web address of a site to make sure it is legitimate before entering your personal information.\nBecause cybercrime covers such a broad scope of criminal activity, the examples above are only a few of the thousands of crimes that are considered cybercrimes.  While computers and the Internet have made our lives easier in many ways, it is unfortunate that people also use these technologies to take advantage of others.  Therefore, it is smart to protect yourself by using antivirus and spyware blocking software and being careful where you enter your personal information."

            "Unlike most computer terms, \"cyberspace\" does not have a standard, objective definition.  Instead, it is used to describe the virtual world of computers.  For example, an object in cyberspace refers to a block of data floating around a computer system or network.  With the advent of the Internet, cyberspace now extends to the global network of computers.  So, after sending an e-mail to your friend, you could say you sent the message to her through cyberspace.  However, use this term sparingly, as it is a popular newbie term and is well overused.\nThe word \"cyberspace\" is credited to William Gibson, who used it in his book, Neuromancer, written in 1984.  Gibson defines cyberspace as \"a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphical representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity.  Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data\" (New York: Berkley Publishing Group, 1989), pp. 128."

            "In the early days of the United States, pioneers traveled west and claimed federal land as their own.  These people were called \"squatters,\" since they claimed rights to the land simply by occupying it.  In the mid-1800s, during the California gold rush, squatters became especially prominent and settled land throughout the west coast.\nIn the early 1990s, a new gold rush began, but this time the rush was for domain names, rather than gold.  Many early Internet users saw the potential value of prominent domain names and began to register as many domains as they could.  Over the course of a few years, nearly all common \"dot coms\" were registered.  Many of these domain names were registered for investment purposes, rather than being used for legitimate websites.  This practice soon became known as \"cybersquatting.\"\nCybersquatters may own anywhere from a single domain to a few thousand domain names.  These \"domainers,\" as they are also called, typically register domain names that contain popular words and phrases.  High profile domain names may generate traffic through manual \"type-ins\" or may simply be attractive to potential buyers.  Some domainers, called \"typosquatters,\" register domain names that are similar to well-known websites, but contain typos.  The goal of these domains is to generate traffic through mistyped URLs.  Generally, cybersquatters profit from their domain names by one of two ways: 1) generating advertising clicks on parked pages (single-page websites), or 2) selling the domains at a significant premium to those interested in buying them.\nWhile some cybersquatters have made huge profits by selling high-interest domain names, others have been forced to give up domains to the rightful owners.  The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) was passed in 1999, which gives owners of trademarked or registered names legal rights to a related domain name.  In general terms, the law states that users cannot register a domain name that is the same or similar to the name of a known entity.  This prevents cybersquatters from extorting money from businesses or individuals by obtaining a specific domain name.\nIf a dispute over a domain name arises, the two parties may bring the case through a legal proceeding.  However, since this is a time-consuming process, ICANN has developed the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), which givens trademark owners a simple means to retrieve domain names from cybersquatters.  While cybersquatters still exist and remain prominent today, the rightful owners of certain names now have an easier (and much less expensive) way of getting the domain names they deserve."
