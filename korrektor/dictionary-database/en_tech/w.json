This is achieved primarily by creating and publishing Web standards.  By adopting the Web standards created by the W3C, hardware manufacturers and software developers can ensure their equipment and programs work with the latest Web technologies.  For example, most Web browsers incorporate several W3C standards, which allows them to interpret the latest versions of HTML and CSS code.  When browsers conform to the W3C standards, it also helps Web pages appear consistent across different browsers.\nBesides HTML and CSS standards, the W3C also provides standards for Web graphics (such as PNG images), as well as audio and video on the Web.  The organization also develops standards for Web applications, Web scripting, and dynamic content.  Additionally, the W3C provides privacy and security guidelines that websites should follow.\nThe World Wide Web Consortium has played a major role in the development of the Web since it was founded in 1994.  As Web technologies continue to evolve, the W3C continues to publish new standards.  For example, many of the technologies included in Web 2.0 websites are based on standards developed by the W3C.

The format chunk describes how the waveform data is stored and specifies the number of channels, sampling rate, and compression type.  The data chunk contains the actual audio data and is separated into channels (such as left and right for a stereo audio recording).  Optional chunks include the silent (\"slnt\") chunk, which defines silent parts of the audio and the wave list (\"wavl\") chunk, which specifies the locations of silent sections.  WAVE files may also include several other optional chunks, such as cue chunk, which marks specific points in the audio, and the info chunk, which is used to store metadata that describes the file.\nThe WAVE format supports several types of media compression, including Microsoft ADPCM, Yamaha ADPCM, a-law, \u00b5-law, GSM, and MPEG compression.  However, most WAVE files store data in an uncompressed (PCM) format.  For example, most Windows programs that rip audio from CDs export the data as uncompressed WAVE files.  These files maintain the original CD-quality audio, which includes two audio channels, a sample size of 16 bits, and a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz.  This is identical to the uncompressed AIFF files exported by most Macintosh audio ripping utilities.  Since the WAVE and AIFF formats are so similar, most DAW applications and audio programs can read and write both formats.\nNOTE: While WAVE files contain binary data, you can tell if an audio file is saved in the WAVE format by dragging it to a text editor.

It improves graphics performance over the previous Windows XP architecture by more fully utilizing a computer's GPU to render system graphics.\nWhen Microsoft released the Vista operating system at the beginning of 2007, dedicated graphics processors (or GPUs) had become standard computer components.  Additionally, GPU performance was increasing by a much faster rate than CPUs.  Therefore, software developers needed an efficient way to \"offload\" as much graphics processing from the CPU to the GPU as possible.  This lead Microsoft to rewrite the graphics driver system during the development of Windows Vista.  The more efficient WDDM graphics architecture was the result.\nOne of the biggest benefits of the WDDM architecture is that it supports GPU multitasking.  This allows Windows users to run multiple graphics intensive applications at the same time.  It also simplifies graphics programming, making it easier for 3D game developers to take fully advantage of a system's GPU.  Additionally, the WDDM offers improved stability by detecting when the driver hangs and restarting the display driver instead of requiring a full system restart.\nWhile the WDDM architecture was introduced with Windows Vista, it is also used by newer versions of the Windows operating systems, such as Windows 7 and Windows 8.  Windows 7 includes WDDM 1.1, while Windows 8 includes WDDM 1.2.  These updates include improvements designed to support new graphics processing capabilities offered by modern GPUs.\nNOTE: WDDM may also be referred to as WVDDM or \"Windows Vista Display Driver Model.\"  However, this term is not commonly used since WDDM is now used by newer versions of Windows."

Examples include GoDaddy, Tucows, Namecheap, and MarkMonitor.  These companies have been approved and accredited by ICANN to register new domain names.  Whenever an individual or organization registers a new domain name, the registrar is required to make the registration information publicly available.  This information can be looked up online using the WHOIS service.\nSince there is no central database of domain registration information, WHOIS search engines look up data across multiple registrars.  Many registrars provide their own WHOIS lookup service, though several third party WHOIS websites also exist.  ICANN provides its own WHOIS lookup service as well (see photo).\nWhat is a WHOIS record?\nWHOIS records vary between registrars, but they all contain mandatory information.  This includes the name of the registrar, created date, updated date, and expiration date of the domain name.  The name servers are also listed.

Unlike a traditional wired LAN, in which devices communicate over Ethernet cables, devices on a WLAN communicate via Wi-Fi.\nWhile a WLAN may look different than a traditional LAN, it functions the same way.  New devices are typically added and configured using DHCP.  They can communicate with other devices on the network the same way they would on a wired network.  The primary difference is how the data is transmitted.  In a LAN, data is transmitted over physical cables in a series of Ethernet packets.  In a WLAN, packets are transmitted over the air.\nAs wireless devices have grown in popularity, so have WLANs.  In fact, most routers sold are now wireless routers.  A wireless router serves as a base station, providing wireless connections to any Wi-Fi-enabled devices within range of the router's wireless signal.  This includes laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other wireless devices, such as smart appliances and smart home controllers.  Wireless routers often connect to a cable modem or other Internet-connected device to provide Internet access to connected devices.\nLANs and WLANs can be merged together using a bridge that connects the two networks.  Wireless routers that include Ethernet ports can automatically combine wired and wireless devices into the same network.\nAdvantages of WLANs\nThe most obvious advantage of a WLAN is that devices can connect wirelessly, eliminating the need for cables.  This allows homes and businesses to create local networks without wiring the building with Ethernet.  It also provides a way for small devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to connect to the network.  WLANs are not limited by the number of physical ports on the router and therefore can support dozens or even hundreds of devices.  The range of a WLAN can easily be extended by adding one or more repeaters.  Finally, a WLAN can be easily upgraded by replacing routers with new versions \u2014 a much easier and cheaper solution than upgrading old Ethernet cables.\nDisadvantages of WLANs\nWireless networks are naturally less secure than wired networks.  Any wireless device can attempt to connect to a WLAN, so it is important to limit access to the network if security is a concern.  This is typically done using wireless authentication such as WEP or WPA, which encrypts the communication.  Additionally, wireless networks are more susceptible to interference from other signals or physical barriers, such as concrete walls.  Since LANs offer the highest performance and security, they are still used for many corporate and government networks.\nNOTE: WLAN should not be confused with \"WAN,\" which is a wide area network."

While WEP provides each authorized system with the same key, WPA uses the temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP), which dynamically changes the key that the systems use.  This prevents intruders from creating their own encryption key to match the one used by the secure network.\nWPA also implements something called the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for authorizing users.

Both require a password with a minimum length of 8 characters.  The technologies differ in the way they encrypt the data.\nWPA uses the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to dynamically vary the encryption key shared between the access point and connected clients.  The continually changing key provides more secure authentication than the earlier WEP wireless encryption standard.  WPA2 further improves Wi-Fi authentication with CCMP, the \"Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol,\" which requires a 128-bit key.\nWPA uses the same RC4 encryption method as WEP, which is considered weak encryption by modern standards.  WPA2 requires AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is significantly stronger and harder to break.  AES encryption supports 128, 192, and 256-bit keys.\nNOTE: Most Wi-Fi networks use WPA2 by default.

The term \"2.0\" comes from the software industry, where new versions of software programs are labeled with an incremental version number.  Like software, the new generation of the Web includes new features and functionality that was not available in the past.  However, Web 2.0 does not refer to a specific version of the Web, but rather a series of technological improvements.\nSome examples of features considered to be part of Web 2.0 are listed below:\n\nBlogs - also known as Web logs, these allow users to post thoughts and updates about their life on the Web.\nWikis - sites like Wikipedia and others enable users from around the world to add and update online content.\nSocial networking - sites like Facebook and MySpace allow users to build and customize their own profiles and communicate with friends.\nWeb applications - a broad range of new applications make it possible for users to run programs directly in a Web browser.\n\nWeb 2.0 technologies provide a level user interaction that was not available before.  Websites have become much more dynamic and interconnected, producing \"online communities\" and making it even easier to share information on the Web.  Because most Web 2.0 features are offered as free services, sites like Wikipedia and Facebook have grown at amazingly fast rates.  As the sites continue to grow, more features are added, building off the technologies in place.  So, while Web 2.0 may be a static label given to the new era of the Web, the actual technology continues to evolve and change."

            "A web application or \"web app\" is a software program that runs on a web server.  Unlike traditional desktop applications, which are launched by your operating system, web apps must be accessed through a web browser.  \nWeb apps have several advantages over desktop applications.  Since they run inside web browsers,  developers do not need to develop web apps for multiple platforms.  For example, a single application that runs in Chrome will work on both Windows and OS X.  Developers do not need to distribute software updates to users when the web app is updated.  By updating the application on the server, all users have access to the updated version.\nFrom a user standpoint, a web app may provide a more consistent user interface across multiple platforms because the appearance is dependent on the browser rather than the operating system.  Additionally, the data you enter into a web app is processed and saved remotely.  This allows you to access the same data from multiple devices, rather than transferring files between computer systems.\nWhile web applications offer several benefits, they do have some disadvantages compared to desktop applications.  Since they do not run directly from the operating system, they have limited access to system resources, such as the CPU, memory, and the file system.  Therefore, high-end programs, such as video production and other media apps generally perform better as desktop applications.  Web apps are also entirely dependent on the web browser.  If your browser crashes, for example, you may lose your unsaved progress.  Also, browser updates may cause incompatibilities with web apps, creating unexpected issues.\nSome people prefer desktop apps, while others prefer web applications.  Therefore, many software companies now offer both desktop and web versions of their most popular programs.  Common examples include Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, and Intuit TurboTax.  In most cases, files saved in the online version are compatible with the desktop version and vice versa.  For example, if you save a .TAX2013 file in TurboTax Online, you can open and edit the file with the desktop version."

            "A web beacon is a small image file \u2014 usually a transparent 1x1 pixel image \u2014 used for tracking purposes.  It may be placed in a webpage or HTML email to record when the content was loaded.\nHow do web beacons work?\nEach image referenced within a webpage is retrieved from a server.  When the image is loaded, the server records a \"hit,\" which is typically saved in the server log.  A log file on the server can be used to determine when the specific image was accessed and also the IP address that accessed the file.\nThe filename of a web beacon may include a question mark (?) followed by an identifying string, such as: beacon.png?user1234.  The web browser will ignore everything after the \".png\" extension, but the entire string will be recorded as a hit by the web server.  This information can be used to determine when a specific web beacon is accessed.\nWhile any image can be used as a web beacon, small transparent GIFs or PNGs are common since they can be placed unobtrusively on a page.  They may also be used by third-party tracking tools that are not accessed from the main web server.  Examples include analytics code like Google Analytics and affiliate links provided by other companies.  An affiliate link, for example, may include a web beacon before or after the link.  The beacon allows the publisher to record the number of impressions (or number times the link is displayed), which is not possible with a plain text link.\nWeb beacons in email marketing\nWeb beacons are commonly used in email marketing to track the number of users who open and view emails.  For instance, when you view a promotional email, a web beacon hidden in the email may record that you have opened it.  This helps email marketers know which campaigns are effective.  Unfortunately, email beacons may also be used for spam purposes, as they can record valid email addresses.  For this reason, many email clients and webmail interfaces do not automatically load images in emails that are likely to be spam."

            "A web browser, or simply \"browser,\" is an application used to access and view websites.  Common web browsers include Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.\nThe primary function of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or \"mark up\" webpages.  Each time a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may include text, links, and references to images and other items, such as cascading style sheets and JavaScript functions.  The browser processes these items, then renders them in the browser window.\nEarly web browsers, such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, were simple applications that rendered HTML, processed form input, and supported bookmarks.  As websites have evolved, so have web browser requirements.  Today's browsers are far more advanced, supporting multiple types of HTML (such as XHTML and HTML 5), dynamic JavaScript, and encryption used by secure websites.\nThe capabilities of modern web browsers allow web developers to create highly interactive websites.  For example, Ajax enables a browser to dynamically update information on a webpage without the need to reload the page.  Advances in CSS allow browsers to display responsive website layouts and a wide array of visual effects.  Cookies allow browsers to remember your settings for specific websites.\nWhile web browser technology has come a long way since Netscape, browser compatibility issues remain a problem.  Since browsers use different rendering engines, websites may not appear the same across multiple browsers.  In some cases, a website may work fine in one browser, but not function properly in another.  Therefore, it is smart to install multiple browsers on your computer so you can use an alternate browser if necessary."

            "Web design is the process of creating websites.  It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design.  While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, web design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.\nWebsites are created using a markup language called HTML.  Web designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content and metadata of each page.  The layout and appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically defined using CSS, or cascading style sheets.  Therefore, most websites include a combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will appear in a browser.\nSome web designers prefer to hand code pages (typing HTML and CSS from scratch), while others use a \"WYSIWYG\" editor like Adobe Dreamweaver.  This type of editor provides a visual interface for designing the webpage layout and the software automatically generates the corresponding HTML and CSS code.  Another popular way to design websites is with a content management system like WordPress or Joomla.  These services provide different website templates that can be used as a starting point for a new website.  Webmasters can then add content and customize the layout using a web-based interface.\nWhile HTML and CSS are used to design the look and feel of a website, images must be created separately.  Therefore, graphic design may overlap with web design, since graphic designers often create images for use on the Web.  Some graphics programs like Adobe Photoshop even include a \"Save for Web\u2026\" option that provides an easy way to export images in a format optimized for web publishing."

Technically, a web designer only designs website interfaces using HTML and CSS.  A web developer may be involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP.  Additionally, a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website.\nWeb development includes many types of web content creation.  Some examples include hand coding web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like Dreamweaver, and updating a blog via a blogging website.  In recent years, content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla have also become popular means of web development.  These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own website using a web-based interface.\nWhile there are several methods of creating websites, there is often a trade-off between simplicity and customization.  Therefore, most large businesses do not use content management systems, but instead have a dedicated Web development team that designs and maintains the company's website(s).  Small organizations and individuals are more likely to choose a solution like WordPress that provides a basic website template and simplified editing tools.\nNOTE: JavaScript programming is a type of web development that is generally not considered part of web design.

When posting in a forum, you can create new topics (or \"threads\") or post replies within existing threads.\nWeb forums are available for all kinds of topics.

There are forums related to health, fitness, cars, houses, teaching, parenting, and thousands of other topics.  Some forums are general, like a fitness forum, while others are more specific, such as a forum for yoga instructors.\nSince Web forums are comprised of user-generated content (UGC), they continue to grow as long as users visit the site and post messages.  The webmaster of a Web forum simply needs to manage the forum, which may require moving, combining, and archiving threads.  It may also involve monitoring postings and removing ones that are inappropriate.  While this can be a large task for popular forums, most forum software, like vBulletin and phpBB, can filter out inappropriate content.\nBecause Web forums are constantly growing, they have become a large part of the Web.  In fact, if you search for help on a certain topic, there is a good chance one or more forum pages will appear in the top results.  After all, if you have a question about something, odds are you're not the only one.  You can use forums to glean knowledge from others who have shared your questions in the past.

The most common web service protocol \u2013 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) \u2013 simply adds a header to each XML message before it is transferred over HTTP.\nBusiness-oriented web services may use a standard called UDDI.  This formats data in a specific type of XML known as the Web Services Description Language, or WSDL.  While UDDI transmits .WSDL files instead of standard .XML files, it may still use the SOAP protocol to transfer data.\nMost web services provide an API, or a set of functions and commands, that can be used to access the data.

Yelp provides an API for programmers to access information about businesses, which can be displayed directly in an app or website.

Webcams typically come with software that allows the user to record video or stream the video on the Web.  If the user has a website that supports streaming video, other users can watch the video stream from their Web browsers.\nWebcams can also be used for video chat sessions with other people.  Instead of broadcasting the video on the Web, users can set up a video chat session with one or more friends and have a conversation with live audio and video.

Several other chat programs also work with webcams, allowing users to set up video chat sessions with friends.\nSince streaming video over the Internet requires a lot of bandwidth, the video stream is typically compressed to reduce the \"choppiness\" of the video.

GitHub, for example, provides a list of events that can trigger a webhook, which developers can use to track changes to projects stored in their online repository.\nWhile webhooks are an effective tool, they require an Internet connection between the data source and the web server to function.

Therefore, when the white balance is off, digital photos and recordings may appear to have a certain hue cast over the image.  For example, fluorescent lights may cause images to have a greenish hue, while pictures taken on a cloudy day may have a blue tint.\nSince different types of lighting affect the way a camera's sensor captures color, most digital cameras and camcorders include an auto white balance (AWB) setting.  The AWB setting automatically adjusts the white balance when capturing a photo or recording video.  However, this setting may not always provide the most accurate color.  Therefore, many cameras and camcorders also include preset white balance settings for different lighting conditions.  Common options include fluorescent light, tungsten light (for typical indoor lighting), cloudy conditions, bright sunlight, and camera flash.  By choosing the appropriate white balance preset, you may be able to capture pictures with more accurate color.\nSome high-end cameras and camcorders also include a custom white balance option.  This feature allows you to take a sample of a white object, such as a white wall or a piece of paper, within the current lighting conditions.  By manually setting the white balance to the white color within the sample image, you can set the white balance with a high degree of accuracy.  Of course, if you find out you have already taken several photos with the incorrect white balance setting, you can adjust the color afterwards with an image editing program.\nSome digital video cameras also include a \"black balance\" setting, which is used to define how black should appear in the current lighting conditions.

When a whitelist is used, all entities are denied access, except those included in the whitelist.  The opposite of a whitelist is a blacklist, which allows access from all items, except those included the list.\nThe following are examples of different whitelist applications:\n\nA network administrator may configure a firewall with a whitelist that only allows specific IP addresses to access the network.\nA protected directory within a website may use a whitelist to limit access to certain IP addresses.\nSome e-mail systems can be configured to only accept messages from e-mail addresses that have added to a user's whitelist.\nProgrammers can use whitelists within programs to ensure only certain objects are modified.\n\nWhitelists are a good option when only a limited number of entities need to be granted access.  Because all items not included in a whitelist are denied access, whitelists are considered more secure than blacklists.  However, if only a few entities need to be denied access, a blacklist is more practical."

            "Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows computers and other devices to communicate over a wireless signal.  It describes network components that are based on one of the 802.11 standards developed by the IEEE and adopted by the Wi-Fi Alliance.  Examples of Wi-Fi standards, in chronological order, include:\n\n802.11a\n802.11b\n802.11g\n802.11n\n802.11ac\n\nWi-Fi is the standard way computers connect to wireless networks.  Nearly all modern computers have built-in Wi-Fi chips that allows users to find and connect to wireless routers.  Most mobile devices, video game systems, and other standalone devices also support Wi-Fi, enabling them to connect to wireless networks as well.  When a device establishes a Wi-Fi connection with a router, it can communicate with the router and other devices on the network.  However, the router must be connected to the Internet (via a DSL or cable modem) in order to provide Internet access to connected devices.  Therefore, it is possible to have a Wi-Fi connection, but no Internet access.\nSince Wi-Fi is a wireless networking standard, any device with a \"Wi-Fi Certified\" wireless card should be recognized by any \"Wi-Fi Certified\" access point, and vice-versa.  However, wireless routers can be configured to only work with a specific 802.11 standard, which may prevent older equipment from communicating with the router.  For example, an 802.11n router can be configured to only work with 802.11n devices.  If this option is chosen, devices with 802.11g Wi-Fi chips will not be able to connect to the router, even though they are Wi-Fi certified.\nNOTE: The name \"Wi-Fi\" is similar to \"Hi-Fi,\" which is short for \"High Fidelity.\"  However, \"Wi-Fi\" is not short for \"Wireless Fidelity,\" but is simply a name chosen by the Wi-Fi Alliance."

It provides faster wireless speeds and handles multiple connections more efficiently than the previous 802.11ac standard, also known as Wi-Fi 5.\nSpecs\nWi-Fi 6 supports data transfer rates of up to 1,200 Mbps (1.2 gigabits per second) per stream.  That is roughly 3x faster than Wi-Fi 5's top speed of 433 Mbps per stream.  Wi-Fi 5 allows three simultaneous streams, for a total of 1,400 Mbps.  Wi-Fi 6 supports four streams, for a theoretical maximum speed of 4,800 Mbps.\nThe Wi-Fi 6 standard supports channel bandwidths of 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz.  It can operate on either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequencies and is backward-compatible with older devices that do not support 802.11ax.  An extension of the standard, called Wi-Fi 6E, provides a new 6 GHz frequency band to help reduce wireless congestion on the commonly-used 5 GHz band.\nThe 5 GHz band allows faster data transmission rates than 2.4 GHz, but the 2.4 GHz band has longer range.\nTechnologies\nWi-Fi 6 includes two primary technologies that improve the wireless network efficiency: OFDMA and Multi-user MIMO.\n\nOFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) enables connected clients to share channels.  It reduces latency and improves efficiency, especially in busy wireless networks\nMU-MIMO (Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output) allows more data to be transferred at one time.  It enables access points to communicate with up to eight devices simultaneously.\n\nRequirements\nTo use Wi-Fi 6, you need a Wi-Fi 6 router and a Wi-Fi 6 device, such as a smartphone or laptop with an 802.11ax wireless adapter.  Wi-Fi technologies are backward-compatible, but if either end of the connection does not support Wi-Fi 6, the devices will communicate via the highest common standard.\nNOTE: While Wi-Fi 6 is theoretically several times faster than Wi-Fi 5, actual data transfer speeds are rarely close to the maximum transmission rate.  Several factors can affect download speeds over Wi-Fi, including signal strength, number of active devices, and the Internet speed itself."

While a Wi-Fi signal can cover a radius of several hundred feet, a fixed WiMAX station can cover a range of up to 30 miles.  Mobile WiMAX stations can broadcast up to 10 miles.\nWhile Wi-Fi is a good wireless Internet solution for home networks and coffee shops, it is impractical for larger areas.  In order to cover a large area, multiple Wi-Fi repeaters must be set up at consistent intervals.  For areas that span several miles, this is a rather inefficient method to provide wireless access and typically requires lots of maintenance.  WiMAX, on the other hand, can cover several miles using a single station.  This makes it much easier to maintain and offers more reliable coverage.\nWiMAX is also known by its technical name, \"IEEE 802.16,\" which is similar to Wi-Fi's technical specification of 802.11.  It is considered the second generation broadband wireless access (BWA) standard and will most likely be used along with Wi-Fi, rather than replace it.  Since WiMAX has such a large signal range, it will potentially be used to provide wireless Internet access to entire cities and other large areas.  In fact, some proponents of WiMAX predict it will eventually spread Internet access to all parts of the globe."

For the past three decades, Windows has been the most popular operating system for personal computers.\nEach version of Windows comes with a graphical user interface that includes a desktop with icons and a task bar that is displayed at the bottom of the screen by default.  The Windows \"File Explorer\" allows users to open multiple windows, browse folders, and open files and applications.  Most Windows versions include a Start menu, which provides quick access to files, settings, and the Windows search feature.\nThe task bar at the bottom of the screen is an easy way to identify a Windows desktop.  Conversely, the macOS desktop has a menu bar at the top of the screen.  In Windows, the close, minimize, and zoom buttons are located on the right side of each window's title bar, while in macOS, they are located on the left.\nThe first version of Windows was released in 1985.  Since then, the OS has gone through several major updates.  A few of the most notable Windows releases include:\n\nWindows 3.1 (1992)\nWindows 95 (1995)\nWindows XP (2001)\nWindows 7 (2009)\nWindows 10 (2015)\n\nThe above versions of Windows had long lifespans and were well received by users.  Some of the less-popular versions of Windows, which had shorter lifespans, include:\n\nWindows 98 (1998)\nWindows Me (2000)\nWindows Vista (2006)\nWindows 8 (2012)\n\nMicrosoft has released most versions of Windows with multiple editions, tailored for different users.  For example, Windows 10 is available in \"Home\" and \"Pro\" editions.  The Home edition is sufficient for most users, while the Pro edition includes additional networking and administrative features useful in corporate workspaces.\nWindows runs on standard x86 hardware, such as Intel and AMD processors.  Unlike Apple, Microsoft licenses the OS to multiple manufacturers.  Therefore, numerous companies, such as Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, Lenovo, sell Windows PCs.  Microsoft develops its own line of Windows Surface laptops as well.\nSoftware programs written for Windows may be called apps, applications, or executable files.  Regardless of their label, Windows software programs have an .EXE file extension.  64-bit versions of Windows run both 32 and 64-bit apps, while 32-bit versions only run 32-bit applications."

One of the primary aims of Windows 10 is to unify the Windows experience across multiple devices, such desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones.  As part of this effort, Microsoft developed Windows 10 Mobile alongside Windows 10 to replaces Windows Phone \u2013 Microsoft's previous mobile OS.  Windows 10 also integrates other Microsoft services, such as Xbox Live and the Cortana voice recognition assistant.\nWhile Windows 10 includes many new features, it also brings back the Start Menu, which was dropped in Windows 8.  The new and improved Start Menu provides quick access to settings, folders, and programs and also includes tiles from the Windows 8 interface.  The bottom of the Windows 10 Start Menu includes a search bar that allows you to search both your local PC and the web.\nAnother major change in Windows 10 is the introduction of the \"Edge\" web browser, which is designed to replace Internet Explorer (IE).  While the OS still includes IE, Edge is the default browser in Windows 10.  Other new features include Continuum, which automatically optimizes the user interface depending on whether you are using an external keyboard or touchscreen, and Action Center, which is similar to the Notifications bar in OS X.  Windows 10 also supports multiple desktops on a single monitor and provides Snap Assist, a feature that helps organize windows on the screen.\nOne of the biggest differences between Windows 10 and previous releases of Windows is that the Windows 10 upgrade is available for free to Windows 7 and Windows 8 users.  However, Microsoft still charges a licensing fee for copies of Windows 10 shipped with new computers and for non-upgrade purchases.  The full version of Windows 10 Home is available for $120 and Windows 10 Pro costs $200."

Windows 8, on the other hand, provides an entirely new user interface compared to its predecessor.  This interface (initially called \"Metro,\" but now labeled the \"Modern UI\" style) displays a collection of tiles rather than a traditional desktop environment.  These tiles provide access to commonly used programs and tools, such as Internet Explorer, Maps, Weather, Photos, Videos, Music, and the Windows Store.  Several of the tiles, such as the Weather and social networking tiles are updated in real-time.\nThe goal of the new Windows 8 interface is to function on both traditional desktop PCs, such as desktop computers and laptops, as well as tablet PCs.  Windows 8 supports both touchscreen input as well as traditional input devices, such as a keyboard and mouse.  This flexibility allows Windows 8 to run on a wide range of desktop and portable devices and it is especially well-suited for hybrid computers that include a touchscreen as well as a keyboard and mouse.\nFor users that don't need the touchscreen functionality, Windows 8 still includes the traditional Windows desktop and Windows Explorer, which can be accessed from the home screen.  In other words, if you don't want to use the new tile-based interface, you can simply bypass that \"layer\" of the interface and access the Windows desktop you are used to.  Microsoft has also provided several performance improvements to Windows Explorer and added a few new interface elements, such as \"File,\" \"Home,\" \"Share,\" and \"View\" tabs to the top of each window.  Each of these tabs includes one-click access to multiple options.

Technically, Winsock is an \"Application Programming Interface (API),\" that developers use to make their programs network-enabled.  16-bit applications use a file called WINSOCK.DLL and 32-bit applications use a file called WSOCK32.DLL.  Both of these files are libraries of networking functions (based on TCP\/IP), but they can differ from computer to computer, depending on the vendor.  If you use Windows, you probably use Winsock on a regular basis.  Fortunately, unless you're a Windows programmer, you don't have to understand exactly how it works."

            "In computing terminology, the term \"wired\" is used to differentiate between wireless connections and those that involve cables.  While wireless devices communicate over the air, a wired setup uses physical cables to transfer data between different devices and computer systems.\nA wired network is a common type of wired configuration.  Most wired networks use Ethernet cables to transfer data between connected PCs.  In a small wired network, a single router may be used to connect all the computers.  Larger networks often involve multiple routers or switches that connect to each other.  One of these devices typically connects to a cable modem, T1 line, or other type of Internet connection that provides Internet access to all devices connected to the network.\nWired may refer to peripheral devices as well.  Since many keyboards and mice are now wireless, \"wired\" is often used to describe input devices that connect to a USB port.  Peripherals such as monitors and external hard drives also use cables, but they are rarely called wired devices since wireless options are generally not available.\nWhile many peripherals are now wireless, some users still prefer wired devices, since they have a few benefits over their wireless counterparts.  For example, an Ethernet connection is not prone to signal interference that can slow down Wi-Fi connections.  Additionally, wired network connections are often faster than wireless ones, which allows for faster data transfer rates.  Some users also prefer wired peripherals since their is no need to replace batteries on a regular basis.  Gamers especially prefer wired keyboards and mice since they have lower latency and can be backlit, thanks to the power provided by the USB connection."

            "A wireframe is a three-dimensional model that only includes vertices and lines.  It does not contain surfaces, textures, or lighting like a 3D mesh.  Instead, a wireframe model is a 3D image comprised of only \"wires\" that represent three-dimensional shapes.\nWireframes provide the most basic representation of a three-dimensional scene or object.  They are often used as the starting point in 3D modeling since they create a \"frame\" for 3D structures.  For example, a 3D graphic designer can create a model from scratch by simply defining points (vertices) and connecting them with lines (paths).  Once the shape is created, surfaces or textures can be added to make the model appear more realistic.\nThe lines within a wireframe connect to create polygons, such as triangles and rectangles, that together represent three-dimensional shapes.  The result may be as simple as a cube or as complex as a three-dimensional scene with people and objects.  The number of polygons within a wireframe is typically a good indicator of how detailed the 3D model is.\n3D Rendering\nSince wireframes only contain vertices and lines, they can be rendered very quickly.  Therefore, a complex 3D image or animation might be reduced to a wireframe model so it can be rendered and edited in real-time.  While wireframe representations of 3D animations were commonly used in early 3D design, today's GPUs are so fast, they can often render fully shaded surfaces and textures in real-time with little to no lag.\nNOTE: A \"wireframe\" may also refer to a mockup or prototype of a website layout or app design."

The two most common types of wireless capabilities computers have are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nWi-Fi is the technology used for wireless networking.  If your computer has a wireless card, it is most likely Wi-Fi compatible.  The wireless card transmits to a wireless router, which is also based on the Wi-Fi standard.  Wireless routers are often connected to a network, cable modem, or DSL modem, which provides Internet access to anyone connected to the wireless network.\nBluetooth is the technology often used for wireless keyboards and mice, wireless printing, and wireless cell phone headsets.  In order to use a device such as a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse, your computer must be Bluetooth-enabled or have a Bluetooth adapter installed.\nComputers may also use other wireless technologies aside from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  Products such as remote controls and wireless mice may use infrared or other proprietary wireless technologies.  Because of the many wireless options available, it is a good idea to check the system requirements of any wireless device you are considering buying."

In computer terminology, a wizard is a part of a program that guides you through certain steps.  For example, a wizard in Microsoft Word would help you create and format a new document according to your needs.  This is helpful when creating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, outline, invoice, etc.  Some other examples of wizards are the Finale 2000 wizard, which helps you create a new music composition with your desired instruments, and the PowerPoint wizard, which helps you set up a presentation using a certain theme.\nBasically, a wizard acts as a guide for creating a new document in a software program.  Though wizards can be helpful, sometimes they can be more of a hassle than a help for experienced users.  Some users would rather just create a new document from scratch, without using a wizard.  This is because wizards typically don't offer as much customization as an experienced user may want.  Finally, be sure not to confuse a \"wizard\" with a \"template.\"  A template is a pre-formatted document that has already been created, whereas a wizard is a step-by-step guide that helps you create your own document."

            "Microsoft Word is a word processing program developed for the Windows and Macintosh platforms.  It is included in all editions of the Microsoft Office suite and is also available as a standalone program for Windows.\nThe first version of Word was released for DOS in 1983 and had a text-only interface.  In 1985, Microsoft released a graphical version Word for the Mac OS.  Microsoft released \"Word for Windows\" in 1989, and it soon became the most popular word processing program on any platform.  In 1995, Microsoft changed the name of Word for Windows to simply \"Word\" and bundled the program with Office 95.  Since then, several versions of Word have been released for both the Windows and Macintosh platforms.\nWhile early versions of Word served as basic text editors, modern versions include many advanced word processing features.  Some examples include spellchecking, auto-correct, text formatting, styles, and custom page layouts.  Word documents may also include headers, footers, images, shapes, tables, charts, and \"SmartArt,\" which is used for visually representing concepts and ideas.  Word also includes a \"Track Changes\" feature that allows editors to review documents and add comments and make changes.\nFor many years, Word saved documents in a proprietary binary format.  However, as other office suites began using open formats, Microsoft transitioned to the \"Office Open XML\" format.  This format was introduced with Office 2007 for Windows and Office 2008 for Mac OS X.  Now, Microsoft Word saves documents in a standard XML format that is compressed using Zip compression.  This new format is more compatible with other software and uses less disk space.\nFile extensions: .DOC, .DOCX, .DOT, .DOTX"

Some examples of word processing programs include Microsoft Word, WordPerfect (Windows only), AppleWorks (Mac only), and OpenOffice.org.\nThe first word processors were basically computerized typewriters, which did little more than place characters on a screen, which could then be printed by a printer.  Modern word processing programs, however, include features to customize the style of the text, change the page formatting, and may be able to add headers, footers, and page numbers to each page.  Some may also include a \"Word Count\" option, which counts the words and characters within a document.\nWhile all these features can be useful and fun to play with, the most significant improvement over the typewriter is the word processor's ability to make changes to a document after it has been written.  By using the mouse, you can click anywhere within the text of a document and add or remove content.  Since reprinting a paper is much easier than retyping it, word processing programs have make revising text documents a much more efficient process.\nThe term \"text editor\" can also be used to refer to a word processing program.

Advanced word processing programs can hyphenate long words at appropriate places.  While it is uncommon, sometimes a word, or string of characters ,will take up more than one line.

Its ease of use and unique blogging features have helped it become the most popular blogging tool on the web.\nWordPress provides a web-based user interface for designing, publishing, and updating websites.  Instead of writing HTML, you can simply choose one of many different website templates or \"themes\" that has a design you like.  You can then modify the layout and build a custom navigation bar.  Once the site layout is complete, you can use WordPress' online interface to create individual pages.  Each page may include formatted text, links, images, and other media.  You can publish completed webpages or blog updates by simply clicking the Publish button.\nThe WordPress interface makes it easy for anyone without web development experience to create and publish a website.  The built-in blogging tools provide a simple way to track individual posts, visitors, and user comments.  If WordPress' built-in capabilities are not sufficient for your needs, you can install different plug-ins that provide extra features.  Examples include social media buttons, image galleries, and web forum tools.\nWhile there are thousands of WordPress templates and plug-ins available, the WordPress system still has its limitations.  Because it is a template-based service, you must begin with a pre-built website rather than create pages from scratch.  Additionally, you cannot insert scripts or maintain a database with the same level of control that a custom website offers.  Therefore, most companies and large organizations still hand-code websites or develop them using a WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver.\nFor many individuals, however, WordPress provides a great blogging system that is both convenient and free.  There is no cost to sign up for WordPress or to use the service.  It is even free to publish a custom website or blog at the wordpress.com domain (such as custom-name.wordpress.com).  However, if you want a custom website address or need extra features, such as more disk space or premium themes, WordPress offers \"Premium\" and \"Business\" services for an annual fee."

            "It has been said that a bus stops at a bus station and a train stops at a train station, so what happens at a workstation?  Hm...\nActually, a workstation is a place where work gets done.  It refers to a computer (and often the surrounding area) that has been configured to perform a certain set of tasks, such as photo editing, audio recording, or video production.  An office may have several workstations for different purposes, which may be assigned to certain employees.  For example, one workstation may be used for scanning and importing images, while another is used for editing images.\nBecause workstations often work together like in the example above, they are commonly networked together.  This allows them to send files back and forth over the network, which is important for various types of media production.  To use another example, a user at a photo-editing workstation may prepare images to be used in a video clip.  Once the images are ready, he may send them to another user at a video-editing workstation, where they are incorporated into the video.  Once the video has been put together, the video file may be sent to another user at an audio production workstation where the soundtrack and other sound effects are added.\nWhile workstations are often part of a network, they can be standalone machines as well.  Even a home computer can be a workstation if it is used for certain kinds of work.  So if you want to sound professional, the next time you send an e-mail to a friend from your home PC, you can let him know you are sending it from your home workstation."

            "Worm has two widely different definitions.  One refers to a computer virus and the other is an optical storage technology:\n1) A type of computer virus\nJust like regular worms tunnel through dirt and soil, computer worms tunnel through your computer's memory and hard drive.  A computer worm is a type of virus that replicates itself, but does not alter any files on your machine.  However, worms can still cause havoc by multiplying so many times that they take up all your computer's available memory or hard disk space.  If a worm consumes your memory, your computer will run very slowly and possibly even crash.  If the worm affects your hard disk space, your computer will take a long time to access files and you will not be able to save or create new files until the worm has been eradicated.\nWorms are hard to detect because they are typically invisible files.  They often go unnoticed until your computer begins to slow down or starts having other problems.  Unlike viruses and Trojan horses, worms can replicate themselves and travel between systems without any action from the user.  For these reasons, it is good to have an antivirus program installed on your system that can detect and remove worms before they have a chance to replicate or spread to other computers.  Security updates such as Windows Update also patch security holes that allow worms to infect your computer.  So keep your security updates and virus definitions up-to-date and you should be able to keep your computer worm-free.\n2) An optical storage technology\nWORM can also mean \"Write Once, Read Many.\"  It is an optical storage technology that allows a disc to be written only once but read an unlimited number of times.  WORM devices were introduced in the 1970's and gained popularity as a way of archiving data.  The storage capacity of WORM discs began around 140MB, but increased to more than 3.0GB over the past few decades.  Yet the WORM technology has no standard format, so WORM discs are only compatible with the drives that wrote them.  This limitation has kept WORM equipment relatively expensive and has kept the technology from gaining widespread acceptance.\nToday, most optical drives are based on either CD-R or DVD-R technology.  Unlike WORM discs, CD-Rs and DVD-Rs can typically be read by any CD or DVD drive, regardless of the manufacturer.  Because of their improved compatibility and lower costs, writable CDs and DVDs have all but replaced WORM media."

            "In computer science, a wrapper is any entity that encapsulates (wraps around) another item.  Wrappers are used for two primary purposes: to convert data to a compatible format or to hide the complexity of the underlying entity using abstraction.  Examples include object wrappers, function wrappers, and driver wrappers.\n1. Object Wrapper\nAn object wrapper is a class that encapsulates a primitive data type or another object.  It may be used in Java, for example, to convert a char primitive to a character class.  By converting the primitive to a class, a developer can use a method, such as toUpperCase() to modify the data.  An object wrapper may also be used to convert the properties of a legacy class to ones that are compatible with newer code.\n2. Function Wrapper\nA function wrapper encapsulates one or more functions.  For example, a website's \"send mail\" function may wrap multiple functions that process form data, check the submission for spam, and send the message using a mail server.  A function wrapper may also wrap a single function to allow it to work with newer or older code.  For example, it may change or add parameters to make a function compatible with a newer API.\n3. Driver Wrapper\nA driver wrapper allows a driver to function with an otherwise incompatible operating system.  For example, an older graphics card may only support drivers designed for Windows 7.  If a Windows 10 driver is not available, a driver wrapper may serve as an adapter, allowing the graphics card to use the Windows 7 driver in Windows 10.  Driver wrappers may be provided by either the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a third-party developer."
