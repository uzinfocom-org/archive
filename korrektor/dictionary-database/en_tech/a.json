            "Stands for \"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.\"  The ACID acronym defines four characteristics a database must have to ensure data integrity.  Specifically, these qualities apply to database operations that write data to the database.  Examples include inserting, updating, and removing records.\nThe four ACID elements are described below:\n1. Atomicity\nAtomicity guarantees each transaction is an \"all-or-nothing\" event.  In other words, it succeeds or fails completely.  Atomic operations prevent data corruption by disallowing partial transactions.  If an operation cannot be completed, it is \"rolled back\" to the previous state, as if it never happened.\nSome database management systems may require a specific configuration to be ACID-compliant.  For example, MySQL meets ACID standards, but only when using tables that support atomic operations.  InnoDB tables are ACID-compliant since they support transactions, including COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements.  MyISAM tables, which do not support transactions, are not ACID-compliant.\n2. Consistency\nConsistency is the assurance that only valid data is written to a database.  For example, a database will not accept invalid transactions or unrecognizable data.  Additionally, it may use a \"doublewrite buffer\" that temporarily stores new transactions.  If the database or host system crashes unexpectedly, the data can be restored from the buffer.\n3. Isolation\nIsolation ensures each transaction is handled individually.  Some databases read and write data several times per second, which may require concurrent transactions.  Even when transactions take place at the same time, they can still be isolated from each other.  For example, if one operation fails, it will not affect others taking place at the same time.  Isolation is also essential for database security since it prevents the data in one transaction from being visible to another.\n4. Durability\nDurability guarantees data will be stored once a transaction has been processed or \"committed\" to the database.  It requires that data is written to non-volatile memory so that transactions are not lost if an application crashes or a power outage occurs.\nWhile database software can help ensure database durability, hardware is also important.  For example, a RAID storage configuration can provide redundancy if a storage device fails.  A UPS battery backup can prevent data loss by maintaining electrical power if the primary power source is unavailable.\n\nNOTE: \"Acid\" (lowercase) is a web browser test that checks browser support for specific HTML tags and CSS rules.  The most recent test, Acid3, was produced by the Web Standards Project group in 2008."

Therefore, if an analog input is sent to a computer, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required.  This device can take an analog signal, such as an electrical current, and digitize it into a binary format that the computer can understand.\nA common use for an ADC is to convert analog video to a digital format.  For example, video recorded on 8mm film or a VHS tape is stored in an analog format.  In order to transfer the video to a computer, the video must be converted to a digital format.  This can be done using an ADC video conversion box, which typically has composite video inputs and a Firewire output.  Some digital camcorders that have analog inputs can also be used to convert video from analog to digital.\nADCs may also be used to convert analog audio streams.  For example, if you want to record sounds from a microphone, the audio must be converted from the microphone's analog signal into a digital signal that the computer can understand.  This is why all sound cards that have an analog audio input also require an ADC that converts the incoming audio signal to a digital format.  The accuracy of the audio conversion depends on the sampling rate used in the conversion process.  Higher sampling rates provide a better estimation of the analog signal, and therefore produce a higher-quality sound.\nWhile ADCs convert analog inputs into a digital format that computers can recognize, sometimes a computer must output an analog signal.  For this type of conversion, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is used.\nNOTE: ADC can also stand for \"Apple Display Connector,\" which was a proprietary video connector developed by Apple.  It combined DVI, USB, and AC power into a single cable.  Apple stopped producing computers with ADC ports in 2004 in favor of the standard DVI connection."

The last update to the protocol was AFP 3.4, introduced with Mac OS 10.8 \"Mountain Lion.\"  Later versions of macOS have prioritized SMB as the primary protocol for file sharing.\nNOTE: While modern versions of macOS and macOS Server still support AFP, the protocol does not work with storage devices formatted using the APFS file system."

This is also known as \"CD-quality audio,\" since CDs use the same audio specifications.  AIFF audio takes up just over 10MB per minute of audio, which means a 4 minute song saved as an AIFF will require just over 40MB of disk space.  This is nearly identical to a .WAV file (which uses the same sample size and sampling rate as an AIFF file.  However, it is about ten times the size of a similar MP3 file recorded at 128 kbps, or five times the size of an MP3 file recorded at 256 kbps.\nSince compressed and uncompressed audio files sound nearly the same, most digital audio distributed over the Internet is saved in a compressed format, such as an .MP3 or .M4A file.  This makes downloading audio from websites or the iTunes Store much faster and more efficient.  However, AIFF files are still commonly used for audio recording, since it is important to save the original audio data in an uncompressed format.  By working with uncompressed AIFF files, audio engineers can ensure that the sound quality is maintained throughout the mixing and mastering process.  Once the final version of a song or other audio project is saved, it can then be exported in a compressed format.\nNOTE: While the standard AIFF format does not support compressed audio data, Apple developed a variation of the AIFF format, called AIFF-C, which supports audio compression.  This format is also based on the original IFF format, but includes extra space in the file structure to define the type of the compression.

Others are device-related, meaning the hardware cannot keep up with the demands of the app.  For example, if an app is rendering a large document, it may take several seconds to load the data and render the image on the screen.

APFS is designed to provide a more efficient means of storing and accessing files on flash storage devices, such as smartphone and SSDs.  It supports over 9 quintillion files on a single storage device, compared to the roughly 4.3 billion files supported by HFS+.  APFS natively supports full disk encryption, while HFS+ does not.\nAPFS provides a number of significant performance improvements over HFS+.  It requires less memory overhead and has lower latency than HFS+.  This means reading and writing files is faster, speeding up common operations such as opening documents and browsing large numbers of files.  Copying is much more efficient since file clones are created by simply adding a pointer to the original file rather than duplicating the file.  This creates copies instantly without requiring additional disk space.  When a copied file is modified, the updates are recorded as \"deltas\" or changes to the file.\nLike its predecessor, the Apple File System supports TRIM to improve the lifespan of SSDs.  It also adds \"Space Sharing,\" which allows multiple APFS volumes to share the same free space on a physical storage device, or \"container.\"  This allows APFS-formatted volumes to grow (or shrink) as needed without repartitioning.  Instead of journaling (implemented by HFS+), APFS tracks changes using a copy-on-write metadata scheme to record changes to the file system.  This prevents file corruption caused by unexpected crashes and reduces the overhead of journaling.\nNOTE: APFS is automatically used in Macs with flash memory drives running macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later.

For example, if a player averages one action each second, his or her APM is 60.  If a player averages 2.5 actions per second, he or she has an APM of 150.\nAPM applies to several different games, but it is most beneficial in real-time strategy (RTS) games.  For example, games like StarCraft and Age of Empires require players to multitask in real-time.  A player with a high APM will be able to accomplish more in a given time than a player with a lower APM.  This provides a significant advantage when competing against players online or in eSports competitions.\nWhat is an \"Action?\"\nAn action is a single mouse click or keystroke entered during gameplay.  For example, clicking the cursor on a unit, pressing \"A\" to attack, then clicking the cursor on the attack location is three actions.  Mouse movements are generally not considered actions.\nA high or \"fast\" APM in StarCraft 2 is 400 to 500 actions per minute.  During peak moments of gameplay, professional players may exceed 800 APM.\nWhile APM is an important metric in RTS gaming, it is not the only ability that matters.  Other important skills include:\n\nStrategy - understanding the game and creating effective methods to win\nDecision-making - knowing when to defend, when to attack, and how to adapt in the middle of a game\nMicro - controlling individual units, especially during combat\nMacro - continuously making units and structures, and using resources efficiently\n\nAPM is most important in RTS games, but it can apply to other video games as well.  For example, it helps to have a high APM in first-person shooter (FPS) games like Call of Duty and Overwatch.  Being \"fast\" is also advantageous in fighting games like Street Fighter and Super Smash Bros.  However, accuracy is often more critical than speed in these games, so APM is not as important.\nNOTE: APM may be inflated by redundant actions, such as repeatedly pressing a key or mouse button.  An example is clicking is right-clicking the same location several times in a row when only one click is needed.  Some games include an algorithm that calculates \"effective APM\" or EPM, by removing redundant actions."

The algorithms are frequently updated, which makes ASO an ongoing process.\nBasic app store optimization strategies include:\n\nChoosing a descriptive app name or title\nPublishing an accurate and helpful app description in the app store\nSelecting appropriate keywords for the app store listing\nProviding useful and attractive screenshots\n\nAdvanced ASO strategies that may require more time to implement include:\n\nBuilding a large user base, increasing the popularity of the app\nGenerating a large number of positive ratings and reviews\nHaving other websites or apps link to the app listing\nEnsuring the app is up-to-date and stable.\n\nSome app stores allow developers to advertise their apps within the store.  Similar to paid search advertising, this provides developers with an alternative way to improve their app visibility by paying for a top search result.  Paid placement is not \"organic ASO,\" but is commonly used to boost app downloads, especially when a new app is launched.\nNOTE: ASO may also aim to improve an app's ranking in the Browse section of an app store.  For example, if an app is listed as featured or trending, it may significantly increase the app's visibility and number of downloads."

            "ASP has two different meanings in the IT world: 1) Application Service Provider, and 2) Active Server Page.\n1) Application Service Provider\nAn Application Service Provider is a company or organization that provides software applications to customers over the Internet.  These Internet-based applications are also known as \"software as a service\" (SaaS) and are often made available on a subscription basis.  This means ASP clients often pay a monthly fee to use the software, rather than purchasing a traditional software license.  Some SaaS applications can be accessed via a web browser, while others operate over a proprietary secure port.\n2) Active Server Page\nAn Active Server Page, commonly called an \"ASP page,\" is a webpage that may contain scripts as well as standard HTML.  The scripts are processed by an ASP interpreter on the web server each time the page is accessed by a visitor.  Since the content of an ASP page can be generated on-the-fly, ASP pages are commonly used for creating dynamic websites.\nASP is similar to other scripting platforms, like PHP and JSP, but supports multiple programming languages.  While the default ASP language is VBScript, ASP pages can include other programming languages as well, such as C# and JavaScript.  However, alternative languages must be defined before the script code using the following declaration:\n \nASP pages are part of the ASP.NET web application framework developed by Microsoft.  Therefore, ASP pages are most often found on Windows-based web servers that run Microsoft Internet Information Services, or IIS.  You can tell if you are accessing an ASP page in your browser if the URL has an \".asp\" or \".aspx\" suffix.\nFile extensions: .ASP, .ASPX"

Since then, many variations of the original ATX standard have been developed and some are still used in today's desktop computers.\nThere are several distinct differences between ATX and the AT form factor it superseded.  For example, ATX has an I\/O panel that is twice the height of the AT panel and allows for flexible interface layouts.  It also has different processor, memory, and drive I\/O locations.  These changes provide the following benefits:\n\nFewer cables\nImproved reliability\nSupport for modern I\/O standards like USB\nSupport for integrated graphics\nLarger expansion slots\nEasier processor and memory upgrades\nReduced cost\n\nA full size ATX motherboard is 12 inches wide and 9.6 inches deep (305 x 244 mm).

The audio is routed to speakers, such as Dolby 5.1 surround system (five speakers plus one subwoofer).  The video is typically output to a television.  In a modern home theater, the TV may serve as a monitor since the audio is processed by the AVR and video input is handled by a cable box, Apple TV, or another device.  Smart TVs are an exception since they are both an input device (sending audio and video data to the AVR) and an output device (displaying video from built-in apps or other devices.\nHistory of AVRs\nEarly receivers were not called AVRs since they only handled audio signals.  The inputs and outputs were primarily analog, except for a optical audio connection such as a Toslink or S\/PDIF port.  Eventually, receivers were built to route video signals as well as audio.\nAs digital devices became more common, receivers started to serve a more primary role as the central digital controller of a home theater system.  Since HDMI enables bidirectional communication, devices can now communicate with each other.  For example, an AVR can tell a television to turn on or off and a TV can tell an AVR to change the volume.\nDigital device commands can be synced through an AVR using an HDMI standard called HDMI Consumer Electronics Control or \"HDMI-CEC.\"  Different manufacturers use different names for this technology, including Bravia Sync (Sony), Anynet+ (Samsung), and SimpLink (LG), but most brands work with components made by other manufacturers.\nModern AVRs\nModern AVRs are far more functional than older receivers that simply amplified signals from radio transmissions, audio tapes, and CD players.

A more advanced method is to generate activation keys dynamically based on a user's registration information (such as an email address).  An algorithm in the program can then check the key to see if it corresponds with the email address used to register the software program.  Modern software programs often use online activation, which verifies the key on a remote server.

For example, a DVI to VGA adapter allows you to connect theDVI output of a laptop to the VGA input of a projector.  Most professional audio devices use 1\/4\" audio jacks, while most computers have 1\/8\" \"minijacks\" for audio input and output.  Therefore, 1\/4\" to 1\/8\" audio adapters are often used to import audio into computers.  Likewise, an 1\/8\" to 1\/4\" adapter can used to output audio from a computer to a professional audio system.  Since a large number of audio and video interfaces exist, there are hundreds of audio and video adapters available.\nNetwork cards, or NICs, are also called network adapters.  These include Ethernet cards, internal Wi-Fi chips, and external wireless transmitters.  While these devices don't convert connections like audio or video adapters, they enable computers to connect to network.  Since the network card makes it possible to connect to an otherwise incompatible network, the card serves as an adapter.  Similarly, video cards are sometimes called video adapters because they convert a video signal to an image that can be displayed on a monitor."

            "Adaptive content is digital content that is optimized for multiple devices.  It may include text, images, video, and other types of multimedia.  The content may simply adapt to your screen size or may appear differently depending on the device on which it is accessed.\nThe most popular way to display adaptive content on the web is through responsive web design.  By using CSS media queries and fluid layouts, web developers can create websites that adjust to the size of your browser window.  When you load a responsive webpage, a media query detects your window size and your browser displays the corresponding layout.  Media queries are often used in combination with fluid layouts, which define sections of a page in percentages rather than fixed pixels.  This allows the content to fill different screen sizes more evenly.\nAnother way to display adaptive web content is to detect what device a person is using.  For example, when you access a website on your mobile phone, it may direct you to a separate mobile site that is designed specifically for smartphones.  The layout may include larger text, more simple navigation, and larger buttons to make it easily accessible with a touchscreen.  Mobile sites often use unique URLs, such as m.example.com.\nWhile websites are the most common example of adaptive content, they are not the only kind.  Software, for instance, can be adapted to multiple devices and screen sizes.  Many productivity programs, such as Microsoft Office and Apple's iWork applications are now developed as mobile apps alongside the traditional desktop versions.  Many games that used to only run on desktop computers are now available for mobile devices as well.  Some programs now come in three different versions \u2013 for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\nAdaptive content extends other mediums as well.  For example, a smart home thermostat may have a digital interface that displays temperature and humidity information as well as outside weather data downloaded from the Internet.  You might be able to access this data by logging into your account thorough the web or an app.  Similarly, the information displayed on your automobile's LCD panel might also be accessible through the web or a mobile app interface.  In each case, developers must create adaptive content that displays the information correctly on each device."

Therefore, you can always check the location of the webpage you are currently viewing with the browser's address bar.\nWhile the URL in the address bar updates automatically when you visit a new page, you can also manually enter a web address.  Therefore, if you know the URL of a website or specific page you want to visit, you can type the URL in the address bar and press Enter to open the location in your browser.\nNOTE: The URL typically begins with \"http:\/\/\", but most browsers will automatically add the HTTP prefix to the beginning of the address if you don't type it in.\nThe appearance of the address bar varies slightly between browsers, but most browsers display a small 16x16 pixel icon directly to the left of the URL.  This icon is called a \"favicon\" and provides a visual identifier for the current website.  Some browsers also display an RSS feed button on the right side of the address bar when you visit a website that offers RSS feeds.  In the Safari web browser, the address bar also doubles as a progress bar when pages are loading and includes a refresh button on the right side.  Firefox includes a favorites icon on the right side of the address bar that lets you add or edit a bookmark for the current page.\nThe address bar is sometimes also called an \"address field.\"  However, it should not be confused with a browser toolbar, such as the Google or Yahoo!

This allows web publishers to promote specific products or services related to the content of their websites.  For example, the webmaster of a fashion website may publish affiliate banners for a clothing store.  The owner of a software review website may include affiliate links to different software programs.\nAffiliate marketing is a type of PPS advertising, since affiliates are only paid for sales they produce (unlike PPC advertising).  Therefore, merchants must offer affiliates high enough commissions to make it worthwhile for the publishers to run their ads.  Affiliate commissions vary widely between industries and also depend on average sale amounts.  Low-margin products, such as consumer electronics, may offer commissions as low as 2%, while high-margin products, such as computer software, may offer commissions as high as 75%.  Most affiliate commissions fall in the range of 5 to 20%.\nAffiliate programs provide free marketing for merchants and an extra source of revenue for web publishers.  While it is a win-win partnership, setting up an affiliate system to track sales and generate payments is a complex process.

            "Ajax is a combination of Web development technologies used for creating dynamic websites.  While the term \"Ajax\" is not written in all caps like most tech acronyms, the letters stand for \"Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.\"  Therefore, websites that use Ajax combine JavaScript and XML to display dynamic content.\nThe \"asynchronous\" part of Ajax refers to the way requests are made to the Web server.  When a script sends a request to the Web server, it may receive data, which can then be displayed on the Web page.  Since these events happen at slightly different times, they are considered to be asynchronous.  Most Ajax implementations use the XMLHttpRequest API, which includes a list of server requests that can be called within JavaScript code.  The data is usually sent back to the browser in an XML format, since it is easy to parse.  However, it is possible for the server to send data as unformatted plain text as well.\nWhat makes Ajax so powerful is that scripts can run on the client side, rather than on the server.  This means a JavaScript function can make a request to a server after a webpage has already finished loading.  The data received from the server can then be displayed on the page without reloading the other content.  If a server-side scripting language like PHP or ASP was used, the entire page would need to be reloaded in order for the new content to be displayed.\nWhile you may not realize it, you have probably seen Ajax at work on several different websites.  For example, search engines that provide a list of search suggestions as you type are most likely using Ajax to display the suggestions.  Image searches that produce more thumbnails as you scroll through the results typically use Ajax to retrieve the continual list of images.  When you click \"Older Posts\" at the bottom of a Facebook page, Ajax is used to display additional postings.\nAjax has helped make the Web more dynamic by enabling webpages to retrieve and load new content without needing to reload the rest of the page.  By using Ajax, Web developers can create interactive websites that use resources efficiently and provide visitors with a responsive interface."

Perhaps the most common alert box is the one that pops up when you try to close a document without saving it.  You'll mostly likely see an alert box with the message, \"Save changes to this document before closing?\"  You can select \"Don't Save,\" to discard the changes, \"Save,\" to save the changes before closing the document, or \"Cancel,\" to cancel closing the document and continue working on it.\nMost alert boxes include the standard alert icon -- a triangle with an exclamation point in the middle -- to get your attention.

Search engines use proprietary algorithms to display the most relevant results from their search index for specific queries.\nIn computer programming, algorithms are often created as functions.  These functions serve as small programs that can be referenced by a larger program.  For example, an image viewing application may include a library of functions that each use a custom algorithm to render different image file formats.  An image editing program may contain algorithms designed to process image data.  Examples of image processing algorithms include cropping, resizing, sharpening, blurring, red-eye reduction, and color enhancement.\nIn many cases, there are multiple ways to perform a specific operation within a software program.  Therefore, programmers usually seek to create the most efficient algorithms possible.  By using highly-efficient algorithms, developers can ensure their programs run as fast as possible and use minimal system resources.  Of course, not all algorithms are created perfectly the first time.  Therefore, developers often improve existing algorithms and include them in future software updates.

The \"alpha phase\" of software development follows the early programming and design stages, but precedes the \"beta phase\" in which the software closely resembles the final version.\nSince the alpha phase is an early part of the software development cycle, alpha software typically includes significant bugs and usability issues.  Therefore, while beta software may be provided to the public, alpha software is only tested internally.  The alpha stage is also important for competitive reasons, as the developer may not want to disclose the new features of a software program until shortly before the release date.\nIf a developer is building a small application, he may be the only person who ever tests the alpha version.  Larger programs, however, are often tested internally by a team of developers during the alpha phase.  In some cases, multiple teams may work together on the alpha version of a software program.  Once the programmers have built a working version with all the necessary features, the lead developer may decide to implement a \"feature freeze,\" which means no additional features are planned for the current version of the program.

            "Analog is an adjective that describes a continuous measurement or transmission of a signal.  It is often contrasted with digital, which is how computers store and process data using ones and zeros.\nWhile computers are digital devices, human beings are analog.  Everything we perceive, such as what we see and hear, is a continuous transmission of information to our senses.  This continuous stream of input is not estimated, but received and processed by our brains as analog data.\nAnalog vs Digital Equipment\nThough we live in an era called the \"digital age,\" many analog devices still exist.  For example, a turntable (or record player) is an analog device, since the needle continuously reads the bumps and grooves on a record.  Conversely, a CD player is digital since it reads binary data that represents an audio signal.  A thermometer that displays the temperature using a mercury level or needle is considered analog, while one that displays the temperature on a screen is digital.\nDigital audio\/video equipment and software programs approximate audio or video signals using a process called sampling.  While they may \"sample\" an analog signal several thousand times per second, the digital version is still an estimation.  The analog signal has an infinite number of data points and therefore is more accurate than a digital one.\nWhile analog data has its advantages, digital data is far easier to manage and edit.  Since computers only process digital data, most information today is stored digitally.  Digital data is also easier to duplicate and preserve.  An exact copy of a CD or hard drive can be created over and over again, while copying an analog tape will eventually degrade the quality.\nConverting between Analog and Digital\nIt is possible to convert analog data to digital and vice versa.  For example, you can use an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), to convert analog VHS tapes into digital movies that can be played on your PC.  Similarly digital audio data can be converted to an analog signal that can be played through a speaker.  This is done using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which may exist in either the playback device (such as a computer) or the speaker.\nNOTE: If a speaker receives a digital input (such as a USB or Toslink connection), it must use a built-in DAC to convert the signal to analog.  If it receives an analog input, such as a 1\/8\" audio cable, RCA jack, or speaker wire, the analog signal can be output directly through the speaker."

It makes edges appear less jagged and helps blend colors in a natural-looking way.\nTo understand anti-aliasing, it important to first understand what aliasing is.  Image aliasing is the \"jagged edge\" effect caused by mapping curved and diagonal shapes onto square pixels.  Horizontal and vertical lines can be mapped perfectly onto square pixels, but angled and curved lines must be estimated.  If pixels along the edge are either on or off, the result is a jagged edge, also called \"stair-stepping\" or aliasing.\nAnti-aliasing smoothes edges by estimating the colors along each edge.  Instead of pixels being on or off, they are somewhere in between.  For example, a black diagonal line against a white background might be shades of light and dark grey instead of black and white.  A blue circle on a yellow background might have shades of blue, yellow, and green along the edges instead of solid blue and yellow.\nThe goal of an anti-aliasing algorithm is to make a digital image look natural when viewed from a typical viewing distance.  When zoomed in, anti-aliased images and text may appear fuzzy because of the estimated pixels.\nAliasing is most noticeable on screens with a low DPI (dots per inch).  Modern HiDPI screens have a denser grid of pixels that can represent edges more accurately.  However, even HiDPI screens still benefit from anti-aliasing.\nNOTE: Anti-aliasing in digital audio is the removal of unwanted frequencies from sampled audio."

As the iPhone and App Store grew in popularity, the term \"app\" became the standard way to refer to mobile applications.  Programs for Android and Windows Phone are now called \"apps\" as well.\nUnlike applications for traditional PCs (often called \"desktop applications\"), mobile apps can only be obtained by downloading them from an online app store.  Most devices automatically install apps when downloaded, which creates a seamless installation process for the user.  Some apps are free, while others must be purchased.  However, mobile apps are typically much cheaper than PC applications, and many are available for only 99 cents.  In fact, most paid apps are less than $10.\nPart of the reason mobile apps are cheaper than desktop applications is because they are often less advanced and take less resources to develop.  Apps are limited to the capabilities of the mobile operating system (such as iOS or Android) and therefore may not offer as much functionality as a desktop program.  For example, a word processor for Android will most likely have significantly less features than a word processing application for Windows.

            "An applet is a small application designed to run within another application.  While the term \"applet\" is sometimes used to describe small programs included with a computer's operating system, it usually refers to Java applets, or small applications written in the Java programming language.\nUnlike ordinary applications, Java applets cannot be run directly by the operating system.  Instead, they must run within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), or within another program that includes a Java plug-in.  If there is no JRE installed, Java applets will not run.  Fortunately, Java is freely available for Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, which means you can easily download and install the appropriate JRE for your system.  Since Java applets run within the JRE and are not executed by the operating system, they are crossplatform, meaning a single applet can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.\nWhile applets can serve as basic desktop applications, they have limited access to system resources and therefore are not ideal for complex programs.  However, their small size and crossplatform nature make them suitable for Web-based applications.  Examples of applets designed to run in web browsers include calculators, drawing programs, animations, and video games.  Web-based applets can run in any browser on any operating system and long as the Java plug-in is installed.\nDuring the early years of the Web, Java applets provided a way for webmasters to add interactive features that were not possible with basic HTML.  However, in recent years, applets have been slowly replaced by newer technologies such as jQuery and HTML 5.  Some browsers, like Google Chrome, no longer support the &lt;applet&gt; tag, and others, like Apple Safari, do not even enable Java by default.  Since web developers cannot fully rely on Java support from web browsers, applets are no longer a common way to provide interactive content on the Web."

Computer architecture is a broad topic that includes everything from the relationship between multiple computers (such as a \"client-server\" model) to specific components inside a computer.\nThe most important type of hardware design is a computer's processor architecture.  The design of the processor determines what software can run on the computer and what other hardware components are supported.  For example, Intel's x86 processor architecture is the standard architecture used by most PCs.  By using this design, computer manufacturers can create machines that include different hardware components, but run the same software.  Several years ago, Apple switched from the PowerPC architecture to the x86 architecture to make the Macintosh platform more compatible with Windows PCs.\nThe architecture of the motherboard is also important in determining what hardware and software a computer system will support.  The motherboard design is often called the \"chipset\" and defines what processor models and other components will work with the motherboard.  For example, while two motherboards may both support x86 processors, one may only work with newer processor models.  A newer chipset may also require faster RAM and a different type of video card than an older model.\nNOTE: Most modern computers have 64-bit processors and chipsets, while earlier computers used a 32-bit architecture.

They may also be compressed to reduce the file size or encrypted for security purposes.  The term \"archive\" can also be used as a verb, which refers to the process of creating an archive.\nArchives are useful for consolidating multiple files and folders into a single file.  They are commonly used for backing up data and transferring multiple files between users.  For example, a Web developer may save all the HTML, CSS, and image files for a website in a single archive to share with a graphic designer.  By consolidating all the files in an archive, the developer only needs to send one file to the designer.  If the archive is compressed, it will also take less time to transfer online.\nIn order to open the files in an archive, they must first be extracted from the archive.  Compressed archives must also be decompressed before the files can be extracted.  Both of these processes can be performed using a compatible file decompression utility, such as WinZip, StuffIt Expander, WinRAR, or 7-Zip.  These programs support multiple standard archive formats, as well as their own proprietary compressed file types.\nSome common archive formats include Zip files, StuffIt archives, and TAR files.  Zip files use a standard archive format that is supported by several file decompression programs.

Various backup utilities use the archive bit to determine which files to back up and which files to skip.\nThe archive bit is a file attribute supported by several operating systems, including Windows and OS\/2.  It is typically not visible to the user but is part of the file's metadata.  Setting the archive bit modifies the file itself, so the feature cannot be used on operating systems such as macOS and Unix.  These operating systems use file timestamps to track the last modified dates of files and compare them with the last backup time to determine what files need to be backed up.\nWhile the archive bit provides an easy way to label files for backup, it is not always accurate.  For example, if more than one backup program is running on a computer, the archive bit may be turned off by one program when it has not been backed up by another one.  For this reason, many modern programs use their own backup system, such as a journal of backed up files.  Advanced backup systems may also support incremental backups, which back up multiple versions of a file over time.\nNOTE: Since archive bits are used exclusively for backup purposes, they are sometimes called \"backup bits.\""

When displaying the results, the program will output one element of the array at a time.  This may be done for a specified number of values or until all the values stored in the array have been output.  While the program could create a new variable for each result found, storing the results in an array is much more efficient way to manage memory.\nThe syntax for storing and displaying the values in an array typically looks something like this:\n\narrayname[0] = \"This \";\narrayname[1] = \"is \";\narrayname[2] = \"pretty simple.\";\nprint arrayname[0];\nprint arrayname[1];\nprint arrayname[2];\n\n\nThe above commands would print the first three values of the array, or \"This is pretty simple.\"  By using a \"while\" or \"for\" loop, the programmer can tell the program to output each value in the array until the last value has been reached.

The most basic type of AI produces characters that move in standard formations and perform predictable actions.  More advanced artificial intelligence enables computer characters to act unpredictably and make different decisions based on a player's actions.  For example, in a first-person shooter (FPS), an AI opponent may hide behind a wall while the player is facing him.  When the player turns away, the AI opponent may attack.  In modern video games, multiple AI opponents can even work together, making the gameplay even more challenging.\nArtificial intelligence is used in a wide range of video games, including board games, side-scrollers, and 3D action games.  AI also plays a large role in sports games, such as football, soccer, and basketball games.  Since the competition is only as good as the computer's artificial intelligence, the AI is a crucial aspect of a game's playability.  Games that lack a sophisticated and dynamic AI are easy to beat and therefore are less fun to play.  If the artificial intelligence is too good, a game might be impossible to beat, which would be discouraging for players.  Therefore, video game developers often spend a long time creating the perfect balance of artificial intelligence to make the games both challenging and fun to play.  Most games also include different difficulty levels, such as Easy, Medium, and Hard, which allows players to select an appropriate level of artificial intelligence to play against."

After reducing the fraction (dividing each number by the lowest common denominator \u2013 in this case, 5), the aspect ratio is 4:3, or \"four by three.\"  4:3 was the aspect ratio used by standard definition (SD) televisions, before HDTV.\nA square screen or image has an aspect ratio of 1:1.  A screen that is twice as tall as it is wide has an aspect ratio of 1:2.  If a screen 50% wider than it is tall, its aspect ratio is 3:2.  Both HDTVs and 4K televisions have aspect ratios of 16:9 (\"sixteen by nine\"), meaning they are almost twice as wide as they are tall.  An HDTV, for example, has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  The 16:9 aspect ratio of HD resolution can be verified using the math below.\n1920 \u00f7 16 = 120.  120 x 9 = 1080.\nAlternatively, 1920 \u00f7 120 = 16.  1080 \u00f7 120 = 9.\n4K is simply twice the width and height of HD, or 3840x 2160.  Therefore, 3840 \u00f7 240 = 16.  2160 \u00f7 240 = 9.\nWhile most modern televisions have 16:9 aspect ratios, other types of screens may be longer or taller.  For example, many tablets and computer monitors have 16x10 (or 8x5) aspect ratios, which means they are slightly taller relative to a standard HD display.  Smartphones often have extra long screens when held sideways (a.k.a. landscape view).  For example, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has an aspect ratio of 18.5:9 and the iPhone X has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9.  When watching HD video on these devices, the video does not fit the full width of the screen.  Instead, black bars are displayed on the sides because the aspect ratio of the video is not as wide as the aspect ratio of the screen.\nNOTE: HD (16:9) is 25% wider than SD (4:3 or 12:9).  That is why modern flatscreen displays appear wider than older CRT televisions."

To send an attachment along with your email, you can use the \"Attach\" command, then browse to the file you want to attach.  In some email interfaces, you can simply drag a file into the message window to attach it.  When you receive an attachment, most email programs allow you to \b\u0006view the attachment in place or save it to your local storage device.\nWhile modern email programs make it easy to send and receive attachments, the original email system (SMTP) was actually not designed to handle binary files.  Therefore, attachments must be encoded as text in order to be transferred with an email message.  The most common encoding type is MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions).  While MIME encoding makes it possible to send messages with emails, it typically increases the file size of the attachment about 30%.  That's why when you attach a file to an email message, the file size of the attachment appears larger than the original file.\nYou can attach multiple files to a single email message.  However, the maximum size of the combined attachments is limited by the sending and receiving mail servers.  In other words, the size of the attachment(s) after being encoded cannot be larger than the limit of either the outgoing or incoming mail server.  In the early days of email, attachments were limited to one megabyte (1 MB).  Today, many mail servers allow attachments larger than 20 MB.  However, to protect against viruses and malware, many mail servers will not accept executable file types, such as .EXE or .PIF files.  If you need to send an executable file to someone, you can compress the file as a .ZIP archive before attaching it to the email message.\nNOTE: Even a large amount of text takes up a small amount of space compared to most binary files.  Therefore, attaching a document to an email may increase the size substantially.  For example, a typical email may only require one kilobyte (1 KB) of disk space.  Attaching a single 1 MB file will make the message 1,000 times larger.  Therefore, it is best to share large files using another method like FTP or DropBox.

As you walk around, your avatar is overlaid on a real-world map, along with in-game content, such as Pok\u00e9stops, gyms, and Pokemon that appear.  When you attempt to catch a Pok\u00e9mon, it shows up with a real-word background created by your smartphone's camera.  The camera can be turned on or off using the \"AR\" toggle switch.\nAugmented reality is also used in television, especially in sports.  For example, golf broadcasts sometimes display a line on the screen that tracks the flight of the ball.  NFL games display a first down line overlaid on the field.  Major league baseball games often display dynamically generated ads behind home plate.  In olympic races, a world record (WR) line is displayed during some races to show how close an athlete is to a record time.\nIn navigation, AR is used to display location information in real-time.  This is typically done through a heads-up display (HUD) that projects images in front of you like a hologram.  For instance, HUD in an automobile might display your speed, engine RPMs, and other useful data.  Google Glass, a head-mounted display, can overlay directions from Google Maps and identify locations using the built-in camera.\nAR vs VR\nWhile augmented reality and virtual reality share some things in common, they are two different technologies.  AR augments reality, but doesn't replace it.  VR completely replaces your surroundings with a virtual environment.

Entering the correct login information lets the website know 1) who you are and 2) that it is actually you accessing the website.\nWhile a username\/password combination is a common way to authenticate your identity, many other types of authentication exist.  For example, you might use a four or six-digit passcode to unlock your phone.  A single password may be required to log on to your laptop or work computer.  Every time you check or send email, the mail server verifies your identity by matching your email address with the correct password.  This information is often saved by your web browser or email program so you do not have to enter it each time.\nBiometrics may also be used for authentication.  For example, many smartphones have a fingerprint sensor that allows you to unlock your phone with a simple tap of your thumb or finger.  Some facilities have retinal scanners, which require an eye scan to allow authorized individuals to access secure areas.  Apple's Face ID (introduced with the iPhone X) authenticates users by facial recognition.\nTwo-Factor Authentication\nAuthentication is a part of everyday life in the digital age.  While it helps keep your personal information private, it is not foolproof.  For example, if someone knows your email address, he or she could gain access to your account by simply guessing your password.  This is why it is important to use uncommon, hard-to-guess passwords, especially for your email accounts.  It is also a good idea to use two-factor authentication when available, as this provides an extra security check when accessing your account.\nTwo-factor authentication (also \"2FA\") typically requires a correct login plus another verification check.  For example, if you enable 2FA for your online bank account, you may be required to enter a temporary code sent to your phone or email address to complete the login process.  This ensures that only you (or someone with access to your phone or email account) can access your account, even after entering the correct login information.\nNOTE: In many cases, you can select the \"Remember Me\" checkbox when logging in to a secure website.  This will store a cookie on your device (computer, phone, tablet, etc.), which indicates the device is trusted, or previously authenticated, for that website.

In Android, this feature is called predictive text, while in iOS, it is called QuickType."

            "Autocorrect is a software feature that corrects misspellings as you type.  It is integrated into mobile operating systems like Android and iOS and is therefore a standard feature on most smartphones and tablets.  It is also supported by modern desktop operating systems, such as Windows and macOS.\nAutocorrect makes it easier to type words on a mobile device with a touchscreens.  Since these devices often have tiny onscreen keyboards, it is easy to make mistakes as you type.  Autocorrect can fix these mistakes on the fly, helping you type faster without having to go back and correct your typos.  Each autocorrect algorithm is different, but the goal is the same \u2014 to replace misspellings with what you intended to type.  In some cases, the algorithm may simply match the closest word (such as replacing  \"mispeling\" with \"misspelling\").  In other cases, it may use guess what letter(s) you intended to type based on nearby keys on the keyboard.  For example, when you are typing a text message, your phone might replace \"see you latet\" with \"see you later.\"\nWhile autocorrect is often associated with mobile devices, it is also found in modern desktop operating systems.  Since the technology is included at the OS level, most applications, such as text editors and word processors include autocorrect support.  While the algorithm on a desktop computer may be different than the one a smartphone, they both work to correct errors as you type.\nAutocorrect can improve your typing efficiency and has the added benefit of teaching you the correct spellings of words that you spell incorrectly.\nMost of the time, autocorrect fixes legitimate errors.  However, sometimes it may try to spell a word differently than you would like.  Before your device autocorrects the text, it will usually display the suggested replacement.  If you prefer to use your own spelling, you can click the \"x\" next to the suggestion to prevent the autocorrection of the word.  Otherwise autocorrect will override your version when you press space bar, Enter, or a punctuation mark.\nIf you prefer not to be autocorrected all, you can turn off the autocorrect feature in your device settings.  Below are a few examples:\n\nWindows 10 - Settings &rarr; Devices &rarr; Typing &rarr; Spelling &rarr; Turn off \"Autocorrect misspelled words\"\nmacOS - System Preferences &rarr; Keyboard &rarr; Text &rarr; Uncheck \"Correct spelling automatically\"\niOS - Settings &rarr; General &rarr; Keyboards &rarr; Turn off \"Auto-Correction\"\nAndroid - Settings &rarr; Language & input &rarr; Google Keyboard &rarr; Text-correction &rarr; Turn off \"Auto-correction\"\n"

        "type": [],
        "definition": [
            "Autofill is a software function that automatically enters data in web forms and spreadsheets.  It should not be confused with autocomplete or autocorrect, which perform separate functions.  Autocomplete finishes words or phrases while typing, and autocorrect automatically fixes spelling mistakes.\nWhile both web browsers and spreadsheet applications support autofill, the functionality is different.  Below is an explanation of how autofill works in each type of application.\nWeb Browser Autofill\nAny time you enter information on a website, you fill out a form.  Some forms, such as login forms, only have two fields (for a username and password).  Others have several fields that you must complete before submitting the form.\nMost online registration and purchase forms require standard information, such as your name, email address, phone number, and home address.  Autofill saves this information in your browser and allows you to fill in common form fields with a single click.\nAutofill can also save other types of information, such as website logins and credit card numbers.  Most browsers securely store usernames and passwords for different websites.  Once your login information has been saved, you can use autofill to fill in the username and password fields with a single click.\nSpreadsheet Autofill\nAutofill in spreadsheet applications, such as Microsoft Excel, provides an easy way to fill in empty cells.  After entering information in one or two cells, you can drag the fill handle (the small box in the lower-right corner of the current selection) across multiple cells to automatically fill them in with similar data.  Autofill can be used for both rows (horizontally) and columns (vertically).\nFor example, if you enter \"1\" in cell A1, then drag the fill handle downwards, autofill will automatically fill in the selected cells with the number 1.  If you enter  \"1\" in A1 and \"2\" in A2, then select both A1 and A2, then drag the fill handle downwards, it will increment the values in the cells.  A3 will become \"3,\" A4 will become \"4,\" etc.  If you enter \"2\" in A1 and \"4\" in A2, the values will increment by two.  For example, A3 will become \"6,\" A4 will become \"8,\" etc.\nAutofill can detect several different patterns, which can save time when creating new spreadsheets.  For example, if you need to enter years as rows and months as column headers, you can use autofill to complete most of the cells.  Simply type the first year, e.g., \"2001,\" in the first cell, followed by \"2002\" below it.  Select the two cells, then drag the fill handle downwards to add as many years as you want.  To enter months, type \"January\" in one cell, followed by \"February\" in the cell next to it.  Then select both cells and drag the fill handle to the right to fill in all twelve months.  Most spreadsheet applications will wrap from December to January if you continue dragging to the right.\nNOTE: Autofill is also called \"AutoFill\" in Apple Safari and \"Auto Fill\" in some versions of Microsoft Excel.\n"

            "An autoresponder is a script that automatically replies to emails sent to a specific email address.  It may be used for away messages, email confirmations, or for several other purposes.\nAutoresponders can be configured on a mail server or using an email client.  When configured on a mail server, the server automatically sends response emails while the autoresponder is active.  Server-based autoresponders are often configured using a webmail interface.  For example, Gmail provides a \"vacation reply\" for this purpose.  They can also be created by a server administrator for one or more email addresses.  cPanel, a popular web hosting platform for Linux, allows admins to manage autoresponders by logging into the control panel for a specific account and selecting Email &rarr; Autoresponders.\nTo set up an autoresponder using a mail client, you typically create a \"rule.\"  For example, you can add a rule that automatically replies to messages sent to a specific email address.  This type of rule works well once it has been configured, but the mail client must be open in order for the autoresponder to work.  If you set up a vacation reply in your mail program on your home computer, then turn off your computer before you leave, the autoresponder will not work.\nWhen setting up an auto-reply on a server, you may be able to enter a date range for when it is active.  If the autoresponder does not turn off automatically, it is a good idea to set a reminder for yourself to turn it off when you return.\nNOTE: Email \"bounce\" messages are sent automatically, but are not considered autoresponders since they are not configured by users."

            "Generally speaking, an avatar is the embodiment of a person or idea.  However, in the computer world, an avatar specifically refers to a character that represents an online user.  Avatars are commonly used in multiplayer gaming, online communities, and web forums.\nOnline multiplayer role-playing games (MMORPGs) such as World of Warcraft and EverQuest allow users to create custom characters.  These characters serve as the players' avatars.  For example, a World of Warcraft player may choose a Paladin with blue armor as his avatar.  As the player progresses in the game, his character may gain items and experience, which allows the avatar to evolve over time.\nAvatars are also used in online communities, such as Second Life and The Sims Online.  These avatars can be custom-designed to create a truly unique appearance for each player. Once a user has created an avatar, he or she becomes part of an online community filled with other users' avatars.  Players can interact with other avatars and talk to them using text or voice chat.  It's no surprise that \"Second Life\" refers to a virtual life that players live through their avatars.\nFinally, avatars are common in web forums.  Online discussion boards typically require users to register and provide information about themselves.  Many give users the option to select an image file that represents the user's persona.  This image, combined with a made-up username, serves as a person's avatar.  For example, a user may select a picture of a Pac-Man and choose the name \"pac32\" for his avatar.  This avatar typically appears next to each posting the user contributes in an online forum.\nRegardless of the application, avatars allow people to represent themselves online in whatever way they want.  They may be considered alter-egos, since users can customize characters that are completely different than their actual personas.  Of course, what's the point of having a \"second life\" if it's the same as reality?"

            "Azure is a cloud computing platform built and operated by Microsoft.  It allows companies to run applications and host content in the cloud.  While Microsoft designed Azure to support enterprise computing requirements, the service is also available to small businesses and individuals.\nThe Azure infrastructure consists of multiple data centers distributed around the world.  The global network of computers provides low latency and high reliability regardless of where users access the service.  Azure includes multiple types of servers, including Windows Server, Linux, and SAP HANA machines.\nBelow are a few examples of the 200+ Azure solutions:\n\nSaaS - running web applications and Internet-based services\nCDN - delivering websites and streaming content from edge nodes around the world\nE-commerce - providing customized shopping cart experiences localized for each visitor\nDatabase storage - enabling high-speed data storage and access\nSoftware testing - providing access to virtual machines that run different operating systems\n\nBecause of the benefits of a globally-distributed computing network, many businesses have moved locally-hosted data to a cloud service like Azure.  While migrating data and applications to Azure may require several steps, starting the process is simple.  Developers can sign up for an Azure account, create a new cloud computing \"instance,\" and start using the service immediately."
