If you connect a device with an MDI port to a device with an MDIX port, a standard straight through Ethernet cable will do the job.  However, when connecting two devices with MDI ports, such as two computers, an Ethernet crossover cable is required.  The crossover cable switches the send and receive ports on the two connectors, allowing data to flow correctly between two MDI or MDIX ports.\nStraight-through and crossover Ethernet cables may look identical, but you can tell the difference by looking at the colors of the wires on each end.  In a straight-through Ethernet cable, the colors will be the same on both ends, while in a crossover cable, the colors will be arranged differently.\nOn some network devices, the ports are labeled MDI or MDIX to help you choose the right type of cable.  Routers often have multiple MDIX ports and a single MDI port called an \"uplink\" port designed to connect a device such as a cable modem.  If you connect a device to the wrong port or use the wrong cable, it may not be able to communicate with the router.\nFortunately, Hewlett Packard developed a technology called Auto-MDIX (or \"MDI\/MDIX Auto Cross\") that automatically switches between MDI and MDIX as needed.  Today, most 10Base-T and 100Base-T network devices have Auto-MDIX ports, so it does not matter if you connect other devices using straight through or crossover cables.

HD Signal\nThe HD connection allows a smartphone or tablet to mirror its screen content on an HDTV in full resolution with almost no latency.  The MHL 1 and MHL 2 standards support a maximum resolution of 1080p at 60 FPS.  This makes it possible to play movies and games from a mobile device on an HDTV with no lag.  MHL 3 supports 4K resolution at 30 FPS.  A new variation of the standard, called superMHL, supports 8K video at 120 FPS.  All MHL technologies support 8-channel high-definition audio.\n2. Power\nWhen an MHL-compatible device is connected to a TV or other hardware that supports MHL, it can receive electrical power at up to 10W (MHL 3) or 40W (superMHL).  Therefore an MHL connection can be used to charge a mobile device and will prevent it from running out of power during a video or gaming session.\n3. Data Transmission\nThe MHL standard supports data transmissions over the Remote Control Protocol (RCP).  This means it can send and receive messages, such as play, pause, volume up\/down, and other commands.  RCP support means you can use your television remote to control your MHL-connected device.\nMHL Interface\nThere is no such thing as an MHL cable.  Instead, MHL operates over existing connectors.  Android smartphones commonly have Micro-USB ports while TVs and other A\/V devices often have HDMI ports.  Therefore, an MHL-compatible Micro-USB to HDMI adapter is commonly required to connect the two devices.  superMHL also supports USB-C, which provides more bandwidth than a Micro-USB cable."

It is primarily used by computers, synthesizers, and electronic keyboards.  However, MIDI is supported by several other instruments, such as electronic drums, beat boxes, and even digital stringed instruments like guitars and violins.\nMIDI data includes several types of information.  For example, pressing a single key on a synthesizer transmits the note played, the velocity (how hard the note is pressed), and how long the note is held.  If multiple notes are played at once, the MIDI data is transmitted for all the notes simultaneously.  Other data that may be sent over a MIDI connection includes the instrument ID, sustain pedal timings, and controller information, such as pitch bend and vibrato.\nWhen a synthesizer is hooked up to a computer via a MIDI connection, the notes played can be recorded by DAW software in MIDI format.  The MIDI data can be played back by sending the recorded MIDI notes to the keyboard, which outputs them as audio samples, such as a piano or strings.  Most DAW software supports MIDI editing, allowing you to adjust the timing and velocity of individual notes, change their pitch, delete notes, or add new ones.  MIDI data is often displayed in a digital format, with lines representing each note played.  Many programs can convert MIDI data to a musical score as well.\nA MIDI recording simply contains instrument information and the notes played.  The actual sound is played back using samples (individual recordings) from real instruments.  For example, a MIDI track recorded as a song for piano can be played back with a guitar sound by simply changing the output instrument \u2014 though it might not sound very realistic.\nOriginally, MIDI connections used MIDI cables, which connected to a 5-pin MIDI port on each device.  Now, most MIDI devices have standard computer interfaces, such as USB or Thunderbolt ports.  These modern interfaces provide more bandwidth than traditional MIDI ports, allowing more tracks with more data to be transmitted at once.\nGeneral MIDI\nThe MIDI standard defines 128 \"General MIDI\" (or GM) instruments, which are available on most computers as software instruments.  The sound of each General MIDI instrument may vary between different computers and keyboards because the samples used for the instruments may be different.  However, the ID for a GM instrument is the same across devices.  For example, GM instrument #1 is always an acoustic piano, #20 is a church organ, and #61 is a french horn.  Modern synthesizers typically include hundreds or even thousands of other instruments that can be selected, most of which provide more authentic sound than the General MIDI options. "

Decades later, SMTP uses the same method.  Email messages that contain attachments include a header that looks something like this:\nContent-Type: multipart\/mixed; boundary =\"[identifier]\"\nOther Internet protocols soon adopted MIME types as a way to identify files transferred over the Internet.

MP3s made it possible for users to download entire albums in roughly the same time it took to download a single WAV or AIFF file.  For over a decade, MP3s were the most common way to store music files on computers and portable music players like the iPod.\nWhile MP3s are still prevalent on the Internet, other file formats are now also used for audio compression.

Ogg Vorbis is an open container format that is frequently used for royalty-free compression and streaming.\nThe MP3 File Format\nAn MP3 file includes a header, metadata, and compressed audio.

For example, a PowerPC processor, which has a RISC architecture, requires different code than an Intel x86 processor, which has a CISC architecture.  A compiler must compile high-level source code for the correct processor architecture in order for a program to run correctly.\nMachine Language vs Assembly Language\nMachine language and assembly language are both low-level languages, but machine code is below assembly in the hierarchy of computer languages.  Assembly language includes human-readable commands, such as mov, add, and sub, while machine language does not contain any words or even letters.  Some developers manually write assembly language to optimize a program, but they do not write machine code.  Only developers who write software compilers need to worry about machine language.\nNOTE: While machine code is technically comprised of binary data, it may also be represented in hexadecimal values.  For example, the letter \"Z,\" which is 01011010 in binary, may be displayed as 5A in hexadecimal code."

            "Machine learning, commonly abbreviated \"ML,\" is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that \"learns\" or adapts over time.  Instead of following static rules coded in a program, ML technology identifies input patterns and contains algorithms that evolve over time.\nMachine learning has a wide variety of applications, many of which are now part of everyday life.  Below are a few examples:\n\nMedical diagnoses\nAutonomous vehicles\nOnline ad targeting \u2013 Google AdSense and Facebook Advertising\nSpeech recognition \u2013 Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and Apple Siri\nImage recognition \u2013 Google image search, facial recognition on Facebook and in Apple Photos\n\nSelf-Driving Vehicle Example\nAutonomous vehicles incorporate machine learning to improve their safety and reliability.  A self-driving car that uses traditional artificial intelligence can respond to any road conditions it has been programmed to handle.  However, if the software encounters unrecognized input, the car may default to a backup safety measure, such as slowing down, stopping, or requiring a manual override.\nMachine learning can enable a vehicle to recognize events and objects that have not been explicitly programmed in the source code.  For example, a car may be programmed to recognize street lights, but not flashing lights on construction barricades.  By learning from experience \u2014 possibly recording the driving behavior of a human driver \u2014 the car will start to recognize construction barriers and respond accordingly.\nML technology is what enables autonomous vehicles to differentiate between objects on the road, such as cars, bikes, humans, and animals.  It also helps automobiles drive more reliably in imperfect weather conditions and on roads without clear lines.  The goal is to enable vehicles to drive like humans while avoiding mistakes caused by human error."

Printed Pages\nWhen you create a new document in a word processor, the default margins are usually defined as one inch on all sides.  However, depending on the program, the side margins may vary anywhere from 0.75 in to 1.25 inches.  These margins create a frame around the content of the page so that the text does not run all the way to the edges.  The white space along the edges of the document makes the page look cleaner and the text is easier to read.\nIn many cases, it is not necessary to edit the page margins.  However, some documents, such as school papers, may require specific margins.  In these cases, you can edit the margins in your word processor's Document Formatting window.  This window can typically be accessed by selecting Format &rarr; Document from the program's menu bar.  In Microsoft Word, you can edit page margins using the Layout tab in the ribbon located above the document.\n2.

It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.  While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are HTML and XML.\nHTML is a markup language used for creating webpages.  The contents of each webpage are defined by HTML tags.  Basic page tags, such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;div&gt; define sections of the page, while tags such as &lt;table&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, &lt;image&gt;, and &lt;a&gt; define elements within the page.  Most elements require a beginning and end tag, with the content placed between the tags.  For example, a link to the TechTerms.com home page may use the following HTML code:\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/techterms.com\"&gt;TechTerms.com&lt;\/a&gt;\nXML is used for storing structured data, rather than formatting information on a page.  While HTML documents use predefined tags (like the examples above), XML files use custom tags to define elements.  For example, an XML file that stores information about computer models may include the following section:\n&lt;computer&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;manufacturer&gt;Dell&lt;\/manufacturer&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;model&gt;XPS 17&lt;\/model&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;components&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;processor&gt;2.00 GHz Intel Core i7&lt;\/processor&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ram&gt;6GB&lt;\/ram&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;storage&gt;1TB&lt;\/storage&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;\/components&gt;\n&lt;\/computer&gt;\nXML is called the \"Extensible Markup Language\" since custom tags can be used to support a wide range of elements.  Each XML file is saved in a standard text format, which makes it easy for software programs to parse or read the data.  Therefore, XML is a common choice for exporting structured data and for sharing data between multiple programs.\nNOTE: Since both HTML and XML files are saved in a plain text format, they can be viewed in a standard text editor.  You can also view the HTML source of an open webpage by selecting the \"View Source\" option.  This feature is found in the View menu of most Web browsers."

For example, in previous versions of OS X, the menu bar was only displayed on one screen, even if a Mac was connected to multiple displays.  In OS X 10.9, the menu bar now shows up at the top of all connected monitors and corresponds to the front application open on that display.  Additionally, each screen can be used in full-screen mode at the same time, which was not possible before.

            "Like file compression, the goal of media compression is to reduce file size and save disk space.  However, media compression algorithms are specific to certain types of media, such as image, audio, and video files.\nMost popular image formats use some type of compression.  Three of the most common include JPEG, GIF, and PNG.  JPEG compression, which is commonly used for digital photos, incorporates a lossy compression algorithm that averages nearby colors and removes color variations that are imperceivable by the human eye.  GIF compression reduces the color palette of an image to 256 colors or less, which provides an efficient way to represent each color within the image.  PNG compression uses a lossless compression algorithm that filters the image data and predicts pixel colors based on other nearby pixels.  While each of these algorithms work in different ways, they can all be used to significantly reduce the file size of an uncompressed image.\nSeveral common audio file formats also use compression to save disk space.  Popular audio formats, such as MP3 and M4A use compression algorithms that remove inaudible frequencies and reduce the dynamics of the sound.  Since uncompressed audio files, such as AIFF and WAVE files, take up a lot of disk space, they are often compressed as MP3 or M4A files before they are distributed over the Internet.  These files are typically around one tenth the size of the original audio files and have nearly identical sound quality.\nMost video files are also compressed.  Popular video formats, such as MPEG and DivX compress video using a specific codec.  Each codec uses a custom algorithm that removes redundant information from the video.  For example, if the background of a video doesn't change for a while, a codec can reduce the file size by not redrawing the background every frame.  A video codec may also incorporate audio compression to reduce the size of the audio track.  Since encoded videos are decoded as they are played, the codec that was used to encode a video must also be available to decode the video.  Therefore, in order to play a compressed video file on your computer, your video player software must have the appropriate codec installed.\nRelated file extensions: .JPG, .GIF, .PNG, .MP3, .M4A, .MPG, .DIVX."

They are a fundamental part of responsive web design and are used to customize the appearance of websites for multiple devices.\nMedia queries may be inserted within a webpage's HTML or included in a separate .CSS file referenced by the webpage.  Below is an example of a simple media query:\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px)\n{\n&nbsp; header { height: 70px; }\n&nbsp; article { font-size: 14px; }\n&nbsp; img { max-width: 480px; }\n}\nThe media query above activates if a user's browser window is 768 pixels wide or less.  This could happen if you shrink your window on a desktop computer or if you are using a mobile device, such as a tablet, to view the webpage.\nIn responsive web design, media queries act as filters for different screen sizes.  Like all modules within a cascading style sheet, the ones that appear further down the list override the ones above them.  Therefore, the default styles are typically defined first within a CSS document, followed by the media queries for different screen sizes.  For example, the desktop styles might be defined first, followed by a media query with styles for tablet users, followed by a media query designed for smartphone users.  Styles may also be defined in the opposite order, which is considered \"mobile first\" development.\nWhile min-width is by far the most common feature used in media queries, many others are available as well.  Examples include min-device-width, min-device-height, aspect-ratio, max-color-index, max-resolution, orientation, and resolution.  The resolution value, for instance, may be used to detect HiDPI displays (such as retina displays) and load high-resolution graphics instead of standard images."

For example, an ISP may offer cable modem Internet access with download speeds up to 200 Mbps and upload speeds up to 20 Mbps.  Fiber connections can provide even faster speeds.  For example, 500\/500 fiber Internet connections are available in certain areas within the U.S. and Europe.  This type of connection provides symmetrical downstream and upstream data transfers at up to 500 megabits per second.\nWhile megabits are used to measure Internet speeds, megabytes are commonly used to measure file size.  This difference can make it tricky to determine how long a download will take to complete.  You must first divide the download speed by eight in order to convert megabits per second to megabytes per second.  For example, if you download a 100 megabyte file at a speed of 40 Mbps, it will take 20 seconds.\n40 Mbps \/ 8 = 5 MBps. &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; 100 MB \/ 5 MBps = 20 seconds."

For example, a 7.2 megapixel camera is capable of capturing roughly 7,200,000 pixels.  The higher the megapixel number, the more detail the camera can capture.  Therefore, the megapixel count is a significant specification to look for when buying a digital camera.\nA camera's megapixel number is calculated by multiplying the number of vertical pixels by the number of horizontal pixels captured by the camera's sensor, or CCD.  For example, the original Canon Digital Rebel captures 2048 vertical by 3072 horizontal pixels, for a total of 6,291,456 pixels (2048 x 3072).  Therefore, it is estimated to be a 6.3 megapixel camera.  The Sony T10 captures 3072 x 2304 pixels, totaling 7,077,888, which makes it a 7.2 megapixel camera (because not all the pixels are used).\nMegapixels are helpful in marketing digital cameras, because it is easier to say, \"6.3 megapixels\" than \"6,291,456 pixels.\"  It is also a little easier to remember.  However, while megapixels are important, it is helpful to know the other specifications of a camera as well.  For example, shutter speed, shooting modes, start-up time, flash quality, and color accuracy can also make a big difference in the camera's performance.  After all, it doesn't matter how many megapixels your camera has if all your pictures turn out blurry and have poor color.  Therefore, while you should check the megapixel count on a camera before buying it, make sure you check the other specs too."

They expanded through technological and social evolution to become commonplace in many cultures.  Now Facebook and email, which are memes themselves, are common mediums used to spread Internet memes.\nAnother type of Internet meme is \"chat slang,\" which includes acronyms and abbreviations used online.  Over the past several years, Internet users have developed ways to communicate faster by creating new shorthand.  Abbreviations like BTW and LOL are part of an entirely new lexicon created by Internet users.  Emoticons, or text-based expressions, such as =) and :-P have become popular memes as well.\nInternet memes may also be subjects, such as people or animals made popular by blogs or other websites.  For example, a politician or celebrity involved in a public scandal may become an Internet meme thanks to numerous bloggers who publish their thoughts on the story.  A household pet may even become a meme if it stars in a YouTube video that goes viral.  These types of Internet memes are typically short-lived, but they are part of the larger meme of social networking, in which people participate in online communities."

            "Just like humans, computers rely a lot on memory.  They need to process and store data, just like we do.  However, computers store data in digital format, which means the information can always be called up exactly the way it was stored.  Also, unlike our memory, the computer's memory doesn't get worse over time.\nWhile memory can refer to any medium of data storage, it usually refers to RAM, or random access memory.  When your computer boots up, it loads the operating system into its memory, or RAM.  This allows your computer to access system functions, such as handling mouse clicks and keystrokes, since the event handlers are all loaded into RAM.  Whenever you open a program, the interface and functions used by that program are also loaded into RAM.\nRAM is a very high-speed type of memory, which makes it ideal for storing active programs and system processes.  It is different than hard disk space in that RAM is made up of physical memory chips, while hard disks are magnetic disks that spin inside a hard drive.  Accessing RAM is much faster than accessing the hard disk because RAM access is based on electric charges, while the hard drive needs to seek to the correct part of the disk before accessing data.  However, all the information stored in RAM is erased when the computer's power is turned off.  The hard disk, on the other hand, stores data magnetically without requiring any electrical power.  For more information on the difference between RAM and hard disk space, view this Help Center article.\nAnother common type of memory is flash memory, which is typically used for small devices such as digital cameras, USB keychain drives, and portable music players like the iPod nano.  This kind of memory, known as \"electrically erasable programmable read-only memory\" (EEPROM), is convenient for portable devices, since it stores information even when its power source is turned off, but is smaller and more resilient than a hard drive.\nTo summarize, memory is a vital part of the way computers and many electronic devices function.  While memory and RAM can often be used synonymously, it is good to know about other types of memory as well.  Hopefully you will be able to store the information you've learned in your own memory."

            "A memory leak is like a virtual oil leak in your computer.  It slowly drains the available memory, reducing the amount of free memory the system can use.  Most memory leaks are caused by a program that unintentionally uses up increasing amounts of memory while it is running.  This is typically a gradual process that gets worse as the program remains open.  If the leak is bad enough, it can cause the program to crash or even make the whole computer freeze.\nThe most common reason programs have memory leaks is due to a programming error where unused memory is not allocated back to the system.  This means the amount of RAM the program uses is always growing.  Therefore, the program is constantly \"leaking\" memory.  A memory leak may also be caused by a program that requests new memory too frequently, instead of using available memory.  This means each time more memory is requested, the program takes up additional RAM instead of using memory that has already been made available to the program.\nFortunately, memory leaks are not as messy as oil leaks and can be more easily fixed.  Software development applications often include debuggers that can check programs for memory leaks.  Once the source of the leak is found, the programmer can modify the code so that the program uses memory more efficiently.  If you are using a program that has a memory leak, you can temporarily fix the problem by simply quitting the program and opening it again.  Once the program has been quit, the memory is automatically allocated back to the system.  Of course, if the leak continues to be a problem, the best solution is to let the developer know about the issue so it can be fixed."

For example, the original SIMMs had 30 pins (which are metal contacts that connect to the motherboard).  However, newer SIMM chips have 72 pins.  DIMMs commonly come in 168-pin configurations, but some DIMMs have as many as 240 pins.  SO-DIMMs have a smaller form factor than standard DIMM chips, and come in 72-pin, 144-pin, and 200-pin configurations.\nWhile \"memory module\" is the technical term used to describe computer memory, the terms \"RAM,\" \"memory,\" and \"RAM chip\" are just as acceptable.

            "A mesh Wi-Fi system is a series of Wi-Fi routers that work together to create a single wireless network.  The goal is to provide a reliable and consistent wireless signal across a large home or workspace.\nA basic Wi-Fi network uses a single router to broadcast a wireless signal to multiple devices.  While this functions well in a small area, the signal may not reach certain locations in a larger space.  Obstructions, such as concrete walls and floors, can create \"dead zones\" where the signal strength drops significantly.  The solution is to spread out a \"mesh\" of routers across the area.\nA mesh network consists of a primary router and one or more nodes or \"points.\"  The router and nodes work seamlessly together to create a single wireless network.  By strategically placing nodes across a home or office, it's possible to eliminate dead zones and provide consistent Wi-Fi coverage across the area.\nAs you move around a mesh network, it intelligently switches your connection to the router with the strongest signal, similar to how cellular towers work.\nThanks to the improved range of Wi-Fi 6, most areas under 2,000 square feet only require a single router.  A mesh Wi-Fi network with a single node generally covers up to 4,000 square feet, while a router with two nodes may be sufficient for areas up to 6,000 square feet.  In a large building with multiple floors, a mesh network may require several dozen nodes for consistent coverage.\nMesh Networks vs Range Extenders\nRange extenders, or repeaters, are an alternative way to boost the range of Wi-Fi coverage.  Unlike mesh nodes, range extenders simply repeat the Wi-Fi signal and do not provide \"intelligent\" switching.  They require separate networks for each repeater, which may each have a different wireless passwords.  Because range extenders do not create a seamless network, Wi-Fi mesh systems are a more popular option."

They are able to maintain a small size by loading most system processes in the user mode rather than the kernel itself.\nA monolithic kernel may include device drivers, file system support, and inter-process communication (IPC) protocols for applications.  A microkernel only includes basic system IPC protocols and memory management functions.  Everything else is loaded in user mode (when a user logs on).  This keeps the kernel size small and also provides a modular type of OS since custom drivers and file systems can be loaded by the kernel.\nMicrokernels were popular in the 1980s because of the memory and storage limitations of early computer systems.  While they are still used for some server OSes, most major operating systems, such as Windows and OS X, use monolithic kernels."

Additionally, manufacturing specifications may state the dimensions of a product must fall within a certain micron number to meet quality control standards.\nWhile a micron is extremely small, it is still too large to measure some computing components such as transistors and bus widths.  These are often measured in nanometers, which are one thousandth of a micron, or one billionth of a meter.\nNOTE: The term \"micron\" used is in both singular and plural cases.

            "A microphone is a device that captures audio by converting sound waves into an electrical signal.  This signal can be amplified as an analog signal or may be converted to a digital signal, which can be processed by a computer or other digital audio device.\nWhile all microphones (or \"mics\") serve the same basic function, they can capture audio in several different ways.  Therefore, multiple classes of microphones exist.  The three most common types are described below.\n\nDynamic - Dynamic microphones are the most widely used microphones.  They have a simple design that includes a magnet wrapped by a metal coil.  A thin sheet called a diaphragm is placed on the front end of the magnet and transmits vibrations from sound waves to the coil.  The coil then transfers these vibrations to electrical wires that transmit the sound as an electrical signal.  Since dynamic microphones use a simple design, they are typically very durable and do not require electrical power. \nCondenser - Condenser microphones are commonly used for audio recording purposes.  They are known for their sensitivity and flat frequency response.  Each condenser microphone includes a front plate (the diaphragm) and a back plate that is parallel to the front plate.  When sound waves hit the diaphragm, it vibrates and alters the distance between the two plates.  This change is transmitted as an electrical signal.  Unlike dynamic microphones, condensers require electrical power.  This current may be provided by an internal battery, but is most often provided as 48 volt \"phantom power\" from an external preamp or mixing console.\nRibbon - Ribbon microphones are also known for their high fidelity.  They contain a thin ribbon made of a aluminum, duraluminum, or nanofilm, which is suspended in a magnetic field.  Incoming sound waves make the ribbon vibrate, generating voltage proportional to the velocity of the vibration.  This voltage is transmitted as an electrical signal.  While early ribbon microphones required a transformer to increase the output voltage, modern ribbon mics have improved magnets that provide a stronger signal \u2013 in some cases even stronger than dynamic microphones.  Though ribbon mics have been largely replaced by condensers, several models are still manufactured and used today.\n\nNot only do microphones come in several different classes, they also use several types of directional patterns to capture audio.  Some microphones are designed with a single \"polar pattern,\" while others have switches that allow you to select the appropriate pattern for a specific recording purpose.  Some of the most common patterns include:\n\nCardioid - a heart or bean-shaped pattern that captures audio from one direction; commonly used for recording vocals or a single instrument.\nBidirectional - a figure 8 pattern that captures audio from two separate directions; may be used for recoding audio from two different sources or to capture reverb.\nOmnidirectional - a circular pattern that captures audio from all directions; often used to capture groups of vocalists or ambient sounds.\n\nNOTE: Microphones perform the opposite action of speakers, which convert electrical signals into sound waves."

            "Middleware has two separate but related meanings.  One is software that enables two separate programs to interact with each other.  Another is a software layer inside a single application that allows different aspects of the program to work together.\nThe most common type of middleware is software that enables two separate programs to communicate and share data.   An example is software on a Web server that enables the HTTP server to interact with scripting engines like PHP or ASP when processing webpage data.  Middleware also enables the Web server to access data from a database when loading content for a webpage.  In each of these instances, the middleware runs quietly in the background, but serves as an important \"glue\" between the server applications.\nMiddleware also helps different applications communicate over a computer network.  It enables different protocols to work together by translating the information that is passed from one system to another.  This type of middleware may be installed as a \"Services-Oriented Architecture\" (SOA) component on each system on the network.  When data is sent between these systems, it is first processed by the middleware component, then output in a standard format that each system can understand.\nMiddleware can also exist within a single application.  For example, many 3D games use a \"3D engine\" that processes the polygons, textures, lighting, shading, and special effects in the game.  3D engines are considered middleware, since they bring different aspects of the game together.  For example, the game's artificial intelligence works in conjunction with the 3D engine to create the gameplay.\nGame engine middleware includes a custom API, which provides developers with standard functions and commands used for controlling objects within the game.  This simplifies game development by allowing programmers to use a library of prewritten functions rather than creating their own from scratch.  It also means 3D engines can be used in more than one game."

        "definition": [
            "In computer science, minification is the process of removing unnecessary elements and rewriting code to reduce file size.  It is commonly done to web page resources, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  Reducing the size of web resources allows the files to be transferred more quickly, making web pages load faster.\nThere are several ways to minify data.  The most basic is to remove comments, unnecessary spaces, and line breaks (newline characters).  While comments and whitespace help make the code more readable, they are ignored by the browser.  Therefore these elements can be safely removed before publishing.  Another method is to minimize the code required for each statement.  In CSS, this is often accomplished by converting longhand CSS to shorthand CSS.  For example, a margin definition might take seven lines in longhand, but only one line in shorthand.  In JavaScript, long variable names can be replaced with shorter ones (often a single character.\nBelow is an example of CSS code before and after minification.  Note how the comments, spaces, line breaks, and unnecessary semicolons are removed.  The code is also converted from longhand CSS to shorthand.\nStandard CSS code\nimg.left &nbsp; \/* float left 400px image *\/\n{\n&nbsp; &nbsp; float: left;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; max-width: 400px;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; margin-top: 8px;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; margin-right: 30px;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; margin-bottom: 12px;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; margin-left: 0px;\n}\nMinified CSS code\nimg.left{float:left;max-width:400px;margin:8px 30px 12px 0}\nAdvanced minification algorithms can reduce file size even further.  A CSS minifier, for instance, may find and remove duplicate lines within a CSS file.  It may also combine similar CSS definitions into a single statement.  A JS minifier may actually rewrite JavaScript functions to be more efficient.\nMinifying code often saves only a few kilobytes.  For example, a standard CSS file may be 50KB and the minified version may be 40KB.  However, when improving page load speed, every kilobyte matters.  The goal of a good minifier is to reduce file size as much as possible with zero impact on the way the code is parsed or processed.  Regardless of what minifier is used, developers typically maintain a non-minified version of the code for future editing.\nMinification vs Compression\nWhile minification and file compression both reduce file size, they are not identical.  Minification simply alters the text while file compression completely rewrites the binary code within a file.  A compressed file must be decompressed by file decompression utility in order to be read as a text file.  Many websites use a combination of minification and \"gzip\" file compression to reduce the size of web resources as much as possible."

If principal server unexpected goes offline, for example, the mirror server can take over.  This process may be performed automatically, but it requires a third system, called a \"witness\" server.

Finally, release the Ctrl key.\nWhile most key combinations require only one modifier key, some require multiple modifier keys.  For example, in Mac OS X, Cmd+Shift+3 takes a screenshot of the screen.  In this case, either modifier key can be pressed first, as long as both keys are held when the \"3\" key is pressed."

It was released on September 24th, 2018 and follows macOS 10.13, also known as High Sierra.\nmacOS Mojave is a minor update to macOS but includes a few notable new features.  One of the most significant is Dark Mode, which makes the menu bar and window backgrounds dark.  It also changes the light grey and white backgrounds of supported applications to dark grey with white text.  Dark mode was inspired by the dark interface of software development IDEs used by programmers and is intended to reduce eye strain.\nOther UI improvements in Mojave include \"time-shifting\" desktops that change color during the day, a new Gallery View in the Finder, and Stacks, which automatically groups similar file types together.  Mojave also includes new document editing capabilities at the operating system level.  For example, the updated Quick Look feature allows you to mark up a PDF or edit an image without even opening it with an application.   You can also edit and share screenshots immediately after taking them.  The screen capture feature in Mojave is the first to support screen recording.\nmacOS Mojave is the first version of macOS to include support for iOS apps.  While only a handful of Apple's own iOS apps were supported by Mojave at the time of launch, Apple plans to allow third party developers to build crossplatform apps that run on both iOS and macOS in the future."

The connector snaps into a receptacle attached to the power supply and locks into place, ensuring a reliable connection.  The 8981 connector's simple and inexpensive design helped it become the standard power connector in desktop computers for several decades.\nWhile the Molex 8981 connector is still used in many PCs, modern storage devices, such as SSDs and SATA drives often use newer types of connectors.  However, other products from the Molex family are still used in many electronic devices.

For example, a monochrome monitor uses one color for the background and another to display text or images on the screen.\nBefore color monitors became standard, most computers had monochrome displays.  These displays often had a black background with green text, though some displayed text in other colors, such as red or orange.  While this may seem like a rudimentary way to display text, it was sufficient for typing documents, since computers still offered more text editing capabilities that a typewriter.  Even after color monitors became the norm in the 1980s, monochrome displays were still used for several years as computer terminals.\nToday, monochrome computer monitors are rare.  By the time LCD displays replaced CRTs monitors in the early 2000s, monochrome screens had already been obsolete for several years.  Now, even basic terminal displays support a wide range of colors.  While you might not see monochrome monitors today, monochrome displays can still be found in other electronics, such as watches, timers, and digital clocks.\nNOTE: Monochrome is not the same thing as grayscale.  A grayscale image is a type of monochrome image that only contains shades of gray.  Additionally, monochrome and black-and-white are two different things.

This is because, along with the keyboard, the mouse is one of the primary input devices used with today's computers.  The name comes from the small shape of the mouse, which you can move quickly back and forth on the mouse pad, and the cord, which represents the mouse's tail.  Of course, if you are using a wireless mouse, the analogy does not work so well.\nAll mice have at least one button, though most mice have two or three.  Some also have additional buttons on the sides, which can be assigned to different commands.  Most mice also have a scroll-wheel, which lets you scroll up and down documents and Web pages by just rolling the wheel with your index finger.\nEarly mice tracked movement using a ball in the bottom of the mouse.  This \"mouse ball\" pushed against different rollers as it moved, measuring the mouse's speed and direction.  However, now most mice use optical technology, which uses a beam of light to track the mouse's motion.  Optical mice are more accurate than roller-based mice and they have the added bonus of not getting dirty inside.\nA plurality of plurals\nWhen you refer to more than one mouse, you can call them either \"mice\" or \"mouses,\" since both terms are acceptable.  However, \"mouses\" is technically the correct version since \"mice\" is the plural form designated for living creatures.  Still, most people have a hard time saying \"mouses,\" which is why \"mice\" is more commonly used."

The slight cushion allowed the mouse ball to roll smoothly in any direction.  Modern mouse pads typically have harder surfaces, designed to track the motion of optical mice.\nMouse pads come in many shapes and sizes.  Most are rectangular, though are some are circular or oval shaped.  While the majority of mouse pads are less than a foot wide or long, graphic artists and CAD designers sometimes use mouse pads that are much larger.  These super-sized mousing surfaces allow them to use a slow, precise mouse speed without needing to lift up the mouse very often.  Computer gamers also prefer larger mouse pads, because they offer more desktop real estate for making long, fast motions.\nSince optical mice track motion by detecting small changes in the surface below the mouse, the mouse pad's surface affects how accurately the mouse responds to movement.  Lighter colored mouse pads typically produce the best results since they reflect the most light.  Some highly reflective mouse pads even claim to have \"battery saving\" capabilities for wireless mice.  The improvement in battery life most likely comes from how quickly the mouse enters low-power mode when it stops moving.\nSince optical mice work on just about any opaque surface, you typically do not even need a mouse pad to use a mouse.  However, a good mouse pad can provide smooth, accurate motion, which is beneficial if cursor accuracy is important for your work.  When choosing a mouse pad, make sure you get one large enough for your needs, but not so large that it won't fit on your desk.  If possible, choose a mouse pad with a built-in wrist rest or buy a separate wrist rest if necessary.  This small ergonomic addition will relieve a lot of strain on your wrist no matter what mouse pad you use."

Since the upper threshold of clock speeds has leveled out during recent years, multi-core processors have become a common means to improve computing performance.\nMost modern computers have at least two cores, or a dual-core processor.  Some high-end machines have four core (quad-core), six core (hexa-core), or eight core (octo-core) processors.  While adding more cores does not increase the overall computing performance by a proportional amount (two cores do not equal twice the speed), multi-core processors do provide a substantial performance boost over a single-core CPUs.

It is used to efficiently transmit streaming media and other types of data to multiple users at one time.\nThe simple way to send data to multiple users simultaneously is to transmit individual copies of the data to each user.  However, this is highly inefficient, since multiple copies of the same data are sent from the source through one or more networks.  Multicasting enables a single transmission to be split up among multiple users, significantly reducing the required bandwidth.\nMulticasts that take place over the Internet are known as IP multicasts, since they use the Internet protocol (IP) to transmit data.  IP multicasts create \"multicast trees,\" which allow a single transmission to branch out to individual users.  These branches are created at Internet routers wherever necessary.  For example, if five users from five different countries requested access to the same stream, branches would be created close to the original source.  If five users from the same city requested access to the same stream, the branches would be created close to users.\nIP multicasting works by combining two other protocols with the Internet protocol.  One is the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), which allows users or client systems use to request access to a stream.  The other is Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), which is used by network routers to create multicast trees.  When a router receives a request to join a stream via IGMP, it uses PIM to route the data stream to the appropriate system.\nMulticasting has several different applications.  It is commonly used for streaming media over the Internet, such as live TV and Internet radio.  It also supports video conferencing and webcasts.  Multicasting can also be used to send other types of data over the Internet, such as news, stock quotes, and even digital copies of software.

However, in recent years, chip manufacturers have reached a limit in how small they can make the transistors inside CPUs without them overheating.  Therefore, using multiple processors, or multiprocessing, has become the next step in increasing computing performance.\nMultiprocessing can be implemented in two different ways: 1) using more than one physical processor, or 2) using a processor with multiple cores.  For example, early Power Mac G5 computers had multiple physical processors, each with their own heat sink and frontside bus.  When Apple switched to using Intel processors in 2006, they began using dual-core processors.  These chips look like a single processor, but act as two.  Now, some machines like the Mac Pro, have quad-core processors, which include four processing cores.  Some Mac Pros even have two physical quad-core processors, giving the computer a total of eight processors.  Most Windows and Linux-based PCs now use multi-core processors as well.\nWhile multiprocessing sounds like a logical choice for improving computing performance, it must be supported by the computer's operating system in order to work correctly.  Fortunately, current versions of both Windows and Mac OS X fully support multiprocessing.  This means they can manage multiple processors as one CPU, dividing the processing load between them.

Unlike the phone and burrito juggling driver, a computer's CPU can handle many processes at one time with complete accuracy.  However, it will only process the instructions sent to it by the computer's software.  Therefore, to make full use of the CPU's capabilities, the software must be able to process more than one task at a time, or multitask.\nEarly operating systems could run multiple programs at one time, but did not fully support multitasking.  Therefore, a single program could consume the computer's entire CPU while performing a certain operation.  Basic operating system processes, such as copying files, prevented the user from performing other tasks, such as opening or closing windows.  Fortunately, since modern operating systems include full multitasking support, multiple programs can run at the same time without affecting each other.  Also, multiple operating system processes can take place simultaneously.\nSince multitasking can handle several tasks at once, it also improves the stability of the computer.  For example, if one process crashes, it will not affect the other running programs, since the computer handles each process separately.  In other words, if you are in the middle of writing a paper in a word processing program and your Web browser unexpectedly quits, you won't lose your work.

MySQL commands can be incorporated into the PHP code, allowing part or all of a Web page to be generated from database information.  Because both MySQL and PHP are both open source (meaning they are free to download and use), the PHP\/MySQL combination has become a popular choice for database-driven websites."

            "MySpace is an online community that allows friends to keep in touch and meet new people as well.  It started out as a website that bands could use to promote their music, but has since grown into a more general community of friends.  Anyone who is at least 14 years old can sign up for a MySpace account at no cost.  Once you sign up, you can customize your profile by adding information about yourself, listing your interests, hobbies, and educational background, and uploading photos of yourself and your friends.  You can also create your own blog for others to read.\nOnce you have created a profile on MySpace, you can search or browse other users' profiles.  If you want to add someone as a friend, just click the \"Add to Friends\" link on that person's profile page.  If the person approves your friend request, he or she will be added to your list of friends.  Some users have only a few friends, while others have several thousand.  You can send a private message to a user by clicking the \"Send Message\" link or post a comment on his or her page by clicking \"Add Comment.\"  Comments can be seen by all visitors to that person's profile, so be careful what you post!\nThe \"friends\" concept is the heart and soul of MySpace.  By building a list of friends, you have your own network of people readily accessible from your profile page.  When you click on a friend's image, you can view their profile and all their friends.  This makes is easy to meet friends of friends, and their friends, and so on.  The number of people you can meet on MySpace is practically endless, which may be a part of the reason there are so many \"MySpace addicts\" out there.\nIn order to create a MySpace account, you need to choose a username and password, which is used for logging in to your account.  This gives you control over what appears on your profile page.  The only way others can add content to your page is through comments, which you can choose to delete once you have logged in to your account."
