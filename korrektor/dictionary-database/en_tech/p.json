For example, a PCI card can be inserted into a PCI slot on a motherboard, providing additional I\/O ports on the back of a computer.\nThe PCI architecture, also known as \"conventional PCI,\" was designed by Intel and introduced in 1992.  Many desktop PCs from the early 1990s to the mid 2000s had room for two to five PCI cards.  Each card required an open slot on the motherboard and a removable panel on the back of the system unit.  Adding PCI cards was an easy way to upgrade a computer, since you could add a better video card, faster wired or wireless networking, or add new ports, like USB 2.0.\nThe original 32-bit, 33 MHz PCI standard supported data transfer rates of 133 megabytes per second.  An upgraded 64-bit, 66 MHz standard was created a few years later and allowed for much faster data transfer rates up to 533 MHz.  In 1998, IBM, HP, and Compaq introduced PCI-X (or \"PCI eXtended\"), which was backwards compatible with PCI.  The 133 MHz PCI-X interface supported data transfer rates up to 1064 MHz.\nBoth PCI and PCI-X were superseded by PCI Express, which was introduced in 2004."

Unlike earlier PCI standards, PCI Express does not use a parallel bus structure, but instead is a network of serial connections controlled by a hub on the computer's motherboard.  This enables PCI Express cards to run significantly faster than previous PCI cards.\nBecause the PCI Express interface is a serial connection, it does not have a speed measured in Megahertz, like PCI or PCI-X.  Instead, its performance is measured in data throughput speeds, which are several times faster than PCI-X.  Furthermore, PCI Express is available in x1, x4, x8, and x16 implementations, which increases the bandwidth by the corresponding amount.  However, larger implementations require longer PCI Express slots.  For example, a x4 slot is larger than a x1 slot and a x16 slot is larger than a x8 slot.  A PCI Express card can be inserted in any slot that is large enough for it.  For example, a x8 card could be inserted into a x16 slot, but a not a x1 or x4 slot.\nSince PCI Express connections can support such fast data transfer rates, they can be used to connect high-speed devices such as Gigabit Ethernet cards and high-end video cards.  For this reason, PCI Express is expected to replace both PCI and AGP connections.  Fortunately, PCI Express was designed to be backwards compatible with both PCI hardware and software.

To prevent the interface from becoming a bottleneck, PCI-X was introduced.\nThe first version of PCI-X supported data transfer rates of 133 MHz, which is more than twice as fast as the original PCI standard.  Then along came PCI-X 2.0, which can run at speeds of 266 or 533 MHz.  These speeds are fast enough to support Gigabit Ethernet cards and video capture devices without slowing them down.

For example, a Type III slot could support Type 1, 2, and 3 cards and a Type II slot could support Type 1 and 2 cards.\nIn the 1990s, PCMCIA cards were a common means of adding extra functionality to laptops.

Additionally, many peripherals that previously required a PCMICA card became available in USB versions.

This is a significant difference between GIF and PNG, since GIF images can include a maximum of 256 colors.\nUnlike the JPEG and GIF formats, the PNG format supports an alpha channel, or the \"RGBA\" color space.  The alpha channel is added to the three standard color channels (red, green, and blue, or RGB) and provides 256 levels of transparency.  JPEG images do not support transparent pixels and GIF images only support completely transparent (not partially opaque) pixels.  Therefore, the PNG format allows Web developers and icon designers to fade an image to a transparent background rather than a specific color.

            "Stands for \"Plain Old Telephone Service.\"  POTS is the traditional telephone system that has been around for nearly 150 years.  It operates over copper wires and was designed for analog signal transmission.\nFor most of the past century, POTS has been the primary telecommunications medium.  The infrastructure, such as telephone poles and telephone wires, can be found throughout the United States and around the world.  Over the past few decades, digital alternatives, such as VoIP and cellular service, have largely replaced traditional phone plans.  Many telephone poles now carry digital fiber optic cables alongside the copper wires.  Some include public Wi-Fi repeaters and cellular transmitters.\nSince telephone poles often carry many types of wires, including power lines, they are now generally referred to as \"utility poles.\"\nWhile POTS is gradually becoming obsolete, there are a few advantages to the traditional phone system:\n\nHigh reliability (roughly 99.999%)\nNo external electrical power required (copper wires carry low voltage)\nLarge existing global infrastructure\nAbility to handle analog and digital signals\nClear, uncompressed voice audio\n\nSome disadvantages of POTS vs modern telecommunications systems include:\n\nNo wireless option (besides in-home handsets)\nExpensive, especially for international calls\nLimited bandwidth for transmitting digital signals (and therefore low speeds)\nRequires significant above-ground infrastructure\nAudio frequency range is limited between 300 and 3,300 Hz\n\nPOTS vs Landlines\nThe terms \"POTS\" and \"landline\" are sometimes used interchangeably.  Often, they mean the same thing.  However, POTS refers to a phone system that operates over analog telephone wires.  A landline may either use POTS or a digital voice service like Vonage or Comcast Digital Voice.  Therefore, POTS requires a landline, but a landline may or may not use POTS."

Therefore, the higher the DPI, the greater the detail of the printed image.  However, even if a photo is printed with a high DPI, the detail represented in the photo can only be as high as the PPI.\nPPI measures the number of pixels per line per inch in a digital photo.  This number is directly related to the number of megapixels a digital camera can capture.  For example, the original Canon Digital Rebel is a 6.3 megapixel camera and captures 2048 vertical by 3072 horizontal pixels.  Therefore, when printing a 4x6 image, the PPI would be 3072 px. \/ 6 in. = 512 PPI.  That is high enough to print a very detailed 4x6 photo.  However, if you were to print a large 20x30 poster image from a 6.3 megapixel image, the PPI would be 3072 px. \/ 30 in. = 102.4 PPI.\nMost modern printers print images with a minimum resolution of 300 DPI.  Therefore, if you print a photo with a PPI of less than 300, you may notice the image is not as sharp as you would like.  Of course, the detail in a 20x30 image may not need to be as clear as a 4x6 photo.  But a good rule of thumb is to keep your PPI above 300 so your prints will look nice and clear."

These speed measurements are typically listed in the printer's technical specifications.\nWhile a higher pages per minute rating does indicate a faster printing speed, this measurement can be misleading.  This is because manufacturers measure the maximum PPM in the fastest printing mode, a.k.a. \"economy mode,\" which is also the lowest quality.  When printing in regular mode, the speed may be twice as slow.  When printing in fine or high-quality mode, the speed will likely be reduced even further.\nFurthermore, a printer's maximum PPM speed is measured using basic text pages, with no graphics, lines, or other objects.  Therefore, if you have a text document that includes a picture, the page could take several times longer to print than a plain text document.  If you are going to be printing a lot of color photos, make sure to check the printer's photo printing speed, which is often significantly slower than the printer's maximum PPM.  Finally, the PPM measurement does not take into account how long it takes the printer to warm up and begin printing.  Therefore, if you are only printing one or two pages, the warm up time may be longer than the actual time it takes to print the document.\nIn summary, PPM gives a general idea of how fast a printer is.  But since there are several other variables involved that determine a printer's speed, PPM does not always accurately reflect a printer's speed.  Therefore, when choosing a printer, it may be helpful to read some reviews about the printer you are interested in.  The reviews may give you a better idea of the printer's real-world speed an quality than the numbers on the box do.\nNOTE: PPM can also be used to measure a scanner's scanning speed.  This measurement is particularly important for scanners that use an automatic document feeder ADF, which allows multiple documents to be scanned consecutively."

It also supports multiple computers on a local area network (LAN).  The downside of PPPoE is that it requires additional overhead, or extra data, to be sent over the Internet connection.  A standard PPPoE connection adds 8 bytes of data to each packet transmitted.

For example, the keyboard port on the back of the computer is often purple, while the mouse port is usually green.  Similarly, the connector on the end of the keyboard cord is purple and the mouse cord connector is green.  This makes it easy for all users to know where to plug the cables into the computer.

Information about the packet is stored in the header.  For example, an IPv6 header includes the following fields:\n\nSource address (128 bits) - IPv6 address of the packet origin\nDestination address (128 bits) - IPv6 address of the packet destination\nVersion (4 bits) - \"6\" for IPv6\nTraffic class (8 bits) - priority setting for the packet\nFlow label (20 bits) - optional ID that labels the packet as part of a specific flow; used to distinguish between multiple transmissions from a single origin\nPayload length (16 bits) - size of the data, defined in octets\nNext header (8 bits) - ID of the header following the current packet; may be TCP, UDP, or another protocol\nHop limit (8 bits) - maximum number of network hops (between routers, switches, etc) before the packet is dropped; also known as \"TTL\" in IPv4\n\nThe payload section of a packet contains the actual data being transferred.

In programming terms, a page fault generates an exception, which notifies the operating system that it must retrieve the memory blocks or \"pages\" from virtual memory in order for the program to continue.  Once the data is moved into physical memory, the program continues as normal.  This process takes place in the background and usually goes unnoticed by the user.\nMost page faults are handled without any problems.  However, an invalid page fault may cause a program to hang or crash.  This type of page fault may occur when a program tries to access a memory address that does not exist.  Some programs can handle these types of errors by finding a new memory address or relocating the data.  However, if the program cannot handle the invalid page fault, it will get passed to the operating system, which may terminate the process.  This can cause the program to unexpectedly quit.\nWhile page faults are common when working with virtual memory, each page fault requires transferring data from secondary memory to primary memory.  This process may only take a few milliseconds, but that can still be several thousand times slower than accessing data directly from memory.

Parallel port cables used for printing often have an even larger 36-pin \"Centronics 36\" connector that connects to the printer.  The original parallel port standard was unidirectional and could transmit data at a maximum speed of 150 kbps.\nAs printers became more advanced, it was necessary to increase the connection speed and also provide bidirectional communication.  Instead of the PC sending a \"print\" command and hoping the print job was successful, the bidirectional capability allowed printers to send messages back to the PC, such as \"ready,\" \"printing,\" and \"complete.\"  Faster transmission speeds enabled the parallel port to be used for other purposes, such as external storage devices like the Iomega Zip drive.\nIEEE 1284\nThe parallel port was eventually standardized by the IEEE as \"IEEE 1284.\"  This standard defined new versions of the parallel port, including the Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) and the Extended Capability Port (ECP).  EPP could transmit data up to 16 Mbps (2 MB\/s).  ECP could achieve data transfer rates close to 20 Mbps or 2.5 MB\/s via an ISA bus.\nWhile the first version of USB was not much faster than a parallel port, it offered other improvements such as a smaller connector and the ability to send electrical voltage to power an external device.  It also was hot-swappable, meaning a USB device could safely be connected or disconnected while a computer is running.  Connecting or disconnecting a peripheral via an IEEE 1284 connection could damage the device or the PC.  The introduction of USB 2.0, which provided data transfer rates of 480 Mbps, made the parallel port obsolete and the IEEE 1284 standard faded into computer history."

            "Parity is a mathematical term that defines a value as even or odd.  For example, the number 4 has an even parity, while the number 5 has an odd parity.  When even and odd values are compared, such as 4 and 5, they are considered to have different parity.  If two even or odd values are compared with each other, they have the same parity.\nIn computer science, parity is often used for error checking purposes.  For example, a parity bit may be added to a block of data to ensure the data has either an even or odd parity.  This type of error detection is used by various data transmission protocols to ensure that data is not corrupted during the transfer process.  If the protocol is set to an odd parity, all packets received must have an odd parity.  If it is set to even, all packets must have an even parity.  Otherwise, a data transmission error will occur and the corresponding packet(s) will need to be resent.\nParity is also used in a type of computer memory called parity RAM.  This type of RAM stores a parity bit with each byte of data to validate the integrity of each byte.  Therefore, 9 bits of data are required for every byte stored in the RAM.  While parity RAM was commonly used in early computers, memory has become more reliable and therefore most systems now use non-parity RAM.  High-end workstations and servers, which require consistent data integrity, typically use ECC RAM, which provides a more advanced means of error checking than standard parity RAM."

It gives the data either an odd or even parity, which is used to validate the integrity of the data.\nParity bits are often used in data transmission to ensure that data is not corrupted during the transfer process.  For example, every 7 bits of data may include a parity bit (for a total of 8 bits, or one byte).  If the data transmission protocol is set to an odd parity, each data packet must have an odd parity.  If it is set to even, each packet must have an even parity.  If a packet is received with the wrong parity, an error will be produced and the data will need to be retransmitted.\nThe parity bit for each data packet is computed before the data is transmitted.  Below are examples of how a parity bit would be computed using both odd and even parity settings.\n\n\n\nOdd parity:\n\nInitial value: 1010101 (four 1s)\nParity bit added: 1\nTransmitted value: 10101011\nResult: Odd parity (five 1s)\n\n\n\nEven parity:\n\nInitial value: 1010101 (four 1s)\nParity bit added: 0\nTransmitted value: 10101010\nResult: Even parity (four 1s)\n\n\n\n\nThe value of the parity bit depends on the initial parity of the data.  For example, the binary value 10000000 has an odd parity.  Therefore, a 0 would be added to keep the parity odd and a 1 would be added to give the value an even parity.\nWhile parity checking is a useful way validating data, it is not a foolproof method.  For instance, the values 1010 and 1001 have the same parity.  Therefore, if the value 1010 is transmitted and 1001 is received, no error will be detected.  This means parity checks are not 100% reliable when validating data.  Still, it is unlikely that more than one bit will be incorrect in a small packet of data.  As long as only one bit is changed, an error will result.  Therefore, parity checks are most reliable when using small packet sizes."

These links may generate advertising revenue for the parked domain's owner when users click on them.\nDomain parking is done for several different reasons.  Some people register domain names hoping to generate \"type-in\" traffic for common words and phrases.  If enough people visit the parked pages on a daily basis, the owners can earn consistent revenue from the clicks on the links or ads.  Domainers or \"cybersquatters\" register large numbers of domain names as an investment, hoping to sell them to interested buyers in the future.  The parked pages for these domains may contain advertisements, but they also include a contact link that visitors can use to make an offer for the domain name.\nMany web hosts display parked pages by default when a domain name has been registered, but a website has not yet been published by the owner.  These pages often state the website is under construction or coming soon and may also include advertisements.  The advertising links on these temporary parked pages generate revenue for the hosting company rather than the owner of the domain name.\nIn some cases, a webmaster may register domain names similar to his or her primary domain name to prevent competitors from using them.  These domain names often display parked pages by default.  The webmaster may also choose to forward the domains to the primary site.

Some operating systems, such as Windows and Linux require multiple partitions, while others like macOS may only require one.  Windows stores system files in a \"System Partition\" and user data files in data partition.  Some Windows drives may also include a \"Recovery Partition,\" which stores files used by the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).  This partition is used to repair problems that prevent the operating system from booting.\nWhen formatting a storage device with a disk utility, you can either use the default partition scheme or create a custom one.  For example, you could format a 2 TB hard drive with three partitions \u2014 a 300 GB partition used for the startup disk, a 700 GB partition for your photo library, and a roughly 1 TB partition for the rest of your data.  These partitions would each appear as separate volumes on your computer even though they are all on one physical disk.  You can mount and unmount any partitions besides the startup disk.\nWhy Partition a Disk?\nPartitioning a disk can make it easier to organize files, such as video and photo libraries, especially if you have a large hard drive.  Creating a separate partition for your system files (the startup disk) can also help protect system data from corruption since each partition has its own file system.  For many years it was advisable to partition hard drives to reduce the minimum sector size and increase performance.  However, with modern file systems and faster HDDs and SSDs, creating multiple partitions no longer has the same benefit.\nOlder operating systems only allowed you to partition a disk during the formatting or reformatting process.  This meant you would have to reformat a hard drive (and erase all of your data) to change the partition scheme.  Modern operating systems and disk utilities now allow you to resize partitions and create new partitions or volumes on-the-fly.  For example, Apple's APFS file system supports resizing partitions and creating new volumes without reformatting."

Since there are ten possible values for each digit (0-9), the number of possible codes is equal to ten raised to the number of digits.  For example, a four-digit passcode can have 104 or 10,000 different combinations.

Since the charge of two wires (both vertical and horizontal) must be altered in order to change a single pixel, the response time of passive-matrix displays is relatively slow.  This means fast movement on a passive-matrix display may appear blurry or faded, since the electrical charges cannot keep up with the motion.  On some passive-matrix displays, you may experience \"ghosting\" if you move the cursor quickly across the screen.\nSince passive-matrix monitors do not display fast motion well, most modern flat screen displays use active-matrix technology.  Instead of managing pixels through intersections of wires, active-matrix displays control each pixel using individual capacitors.  This allows pixels to change brightness and color states much more rapidly.  While most of today's computer monitors and flat screen televisions have active-matrix screens, passive-matrix displays are still used in some smaller devices, since they are less expensive to produce."

It may alter the audio signal using an equalizer or other effects before sending the output to the speakers or another device.

Therefore, petaflops are more often used when calculating the processing power of multiple computers.  Also, since FLOPS only measures floating point calculations, petaflops is not necessarily a good indicator of a computer's overall performance.

            "Pharming is yet another way hackers attempt to manipulate users on the Internet.  While phishing attempts to capture personal information by getting users to visit a fake website, pharming redirects users to false websites without them even knowing it.\nWhile a typical website uses a domain name for its address, its actual location is determined by an IP address.  When a user types a domain name into his or her Web browser's address field and hits enter, the domain name is translated into an IP address via a DNS server.  The Web browser then connects to the server at this IP address and loads the Web page data.  After a user visits a certain website, the DNS entry for that site is often stored on the user's computer in a DNS cache.  This way, the computer does not have to keep accessing a DNS server whenever the user visits the website.\nOne way that pharming takes place is via an e-mail virus that \"poisons\" a user's local DNS cache.  It does this by modifying the DNS entries, or host files.  For example, instead of having the IP address 17.254.3.183 direct to www.apple.com, it may direct to another website determined by the hacker.  Pharmers can also poison entire DNS servers, which means any user that uses the affected DNS server will be redirected to the wrong website.  Fortunately, most DNS servers have security features to protect them against such attacks.  Still, they are not necessarily immune, since hackers continue to find ways to gain access to them.\nWhile pharming is not as common as phishing scams are, it can affect many more people at once.  This is especially true if a large DNS server is modified.  So, if you visit a certain website and it appears to be significantly different than what you expected, you may be the victim of pharming.  Restart your computer to reset your DNS entries, run an antivirus program, then try connecting to the website again.  If the website still looks strange, contact your ISP and let them know their DNS server may have been pharmed."

They send out e-mails that appear to come from legitimate websites such as eBay, PayPal, or other banking institutions.  The e-mails state that your information needs to be updated or validated and ask that you enter your username and password, after clicking a link included in the e-mail.  Some e-mails will ask that you enter even more information, such as your full name, address, phone number, social security number, and credit card number.  However, even if you visit the false website and just enter your username and password, the phisher may be able to gain access to more information by just logging in to you account.\nPhishing is a con game that scammers use to collect personal information from unsuspecting users.  The false e-mails often look surprisingly legitimate, and even the Web pages where you are asked to enter your information may look real.  However, the URL in the address field can tell you if the page you have been directed to is valid or not.  For example, if you are visiting an Web page on eBay, the last part of the domain name should end with \"ebay.com.\"  Therefore, \"http:\/\/www.ebay.com\" and \"http:\/\/cgi3.ebay.com\" are valid Web addresses, but \"http:\/\/www.ebay.validate-info.com\" and \"http:\/\/ebay.login123.com\" are false addresses, which may be used by phishers.  If URL contains an IP address, such as 12.30.229.107, instead of a domain name, you can almost be sure someone is trying to phish for your personal information. \nIf you receive an e-mail that asks that you update your information and you think it might be valid, go to the website by typing the URL in your browser's address field instead of clicking the link in the e-mail.  For example, go to \"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\" instead of clicking the link in an e-mail that appears to come from PayPal.  If you are prompted to update your information after you have manually typed in the Web address and logged in, then the e-mail was probably legitimate.  However, if you are not asked to update any information, then the e-mail was most likely a spoof sent by a phisher.\nMost legitimate e-mails will address you by your full name at the beginning of the message.  If there is any doubt that the e-mail is legitimate, be smart and don't enter your information.  Even if you believe the message is valid, following the guidelines above will prevent you from giving phishers your personal information."

Since phreaking took place before personal computers became popular, it is sometimes considered to be the precursor to computer hacking.\nWhile not all phreaking activities are illegal, the term is often associated with using a phone system to make free long distance calls.  Early phone systems has limited security features, which allowed \"phreaks\" to tap into analog phone lines and make calls free of charge.  This was often done using a device called a \"blue box,\" which simulated a telephone operator's console.  Phreaks could use these devices to route their own calls and bypass the telephone company switches, allowing them to make free calls.  This activity was more prominent before the turn of the century, when cell phone companies began including free long distance service.\nPhreaking has evolved over past several decades along with telecommunications technology.  In the 1980s and 1990s, phreaks began using modems to access to computer systems over telephone lines.  Once connected via modem, tech-savvy users could access private data or exploit computers connected on the local network.  This activity also faded out around the turn of the century as dial-up modems were replaced by DSL and cable modems and new security measures were put into place.

It serves two primary purposes: 1) to check if the host is available and 2) to measure how long the response takes.\nA ping request can be performed using a ping command, which is a standard command in most command line interfaces.  Several network utilities provide a ping feature, which allows you to ping a server by simply entering the IP address or domain name.  Most ping programs send multiple pings and provide and average of the pings at the end.\n To perform a ping command from a command line interface, simply type \"ping\" followed by the IP address or domain name of the host you want to ping (e.g., ping 123.123.123.123).\nThe ping itself consists of a single packet (often 32 or 56 bytes) that contains an \"echo\" request.  The host, if available, responds with a single packet as a reply.  The ping time, measured in milliseconds, is the round trip time for the packet to reach the host and for the response to return to the sender.\nPing response times are important because they add overhead to any requests made over the Internet.  For example, when you visit a webpage the ping time is added to the time it takes a server to transmit the HTML and related resources to your computer.  Pings are especially important in online gaming, where events happen in real-time.\nWhile Internet connection speeds can affect pings, ping response time is often directly related to the physical distance between the source and destination systems.  Therefore, a fast connection between New York and Tokyo will likely have a longer ping than a slow connection between New York and Philadelphia.  Network congestion may slow down pings, which is why pings are often used for troubleshooting.\nWhat is a Good Ping Response Time?\n\n&lt; 30 ms - excellent ping; almost unnoticeable; ideal for online gaming\n30 to 50 ms - average ping; still ok for online gaming\n50 to 100 ms - somewhat slow ping time; not too noticeable for web browsing but may affect gaming\n100 ms to 500 ms - slow ping; minimal effect on web browsing, but will create noticeable lag in online gaming\n &gt; 500 ms - pings of a half second or more will add a noticeable delay to all requests; typically happens when the source and destination are in different parts of the world\n"

Without a pipeline, each instruction would have to wait for the previous one to finish before it could even be accessed.\nTo understand the benefit of a pipeline, imagine that a car manufacturing plant had to wait for each car to be fully completed before starting on the next one.  That would be horribly inefficient, right?  It makes much more sense to work on many cars at once, completing them one stage at a time.  This is what a pipeline in a computer allows.

This name comes from the traditional meaning of the word \"pirate,\" which is a sea-faring criminal that steals and loots belongings from others.  But far from the stereotypical sea pirate, a software pirate can be anyone who owns a computer.  Software piracy is committed by simply downloading or copying a program that a user has not paid for.\nSince computer programs are stored in a digital format, they are easy to copy and reproduce.  For example, a game may be burned to a CD and transferred to the computer of an individual who has not paid for the program.  Software programs can also be illegally downloaded from the Internet from unauthorized sources.  Since pirating software does not require many resources, it has grown into a major problem for the computer industry.\nWhile it may seem like an innocuous act, pirating software is the same as stealing.  Software companies often invest thousands or even millions of dollars into creating the programs they sell.  The income from selling these programs is what allows companies to produce the software and to continue improving the programs we use.  Just because it is possible to copy a software program does not mean it is OK.  Installing a commercial program from an illegal copy is the same thing as walking out of a store with the program and not paying for it.\nWhile there are some programs that are free to use (such as shareware and freeware programs), it is important to pay for commercial software.  You can avoid software piracy by only downloading software from authorized sources and making sure that you have valid software licenses for all the programs you use.  Remember that paying for software programs supports the software industry, which is good for all of us!"

The screen is divided up into a matrix of thousands or even millions of pixels.  Typically, you cannot see the individual pixels, because they are so small.  This is a good thing, because most people prefer to look at smooth, clear images rather than blocky, \"pixelated\" ones.  However, if you set your monitor to a low resolution, such as 640x480 and look closely at your screen, you will may be able to see the individual pixels.  As you may have guessed, a resolution of 640x480 is comprised of a matrix of 640 by 480 pixels, or 307,200 in all.  That's a lot of little dots.\nEach pixel can only be one color at a time.  However, since they are so small, pixels often blend together to form various shades and blends of colors.  The number of colors each pixel can be is determined by the number of bits used to represent it.  For example, 8-bit color allows for 2 to the 8th, or 256 colors to be displayed.  At this color depth, you may be able to see \"graininess,\" or spotted colors when one color blends to another.  However, at 16, 24, and 32-bit color depths, the color blending is smooth and, unless you have some kind of extra-sensory vision capability, you should not see any graininess."

Whenever another person's work is copied and republished without an appropriate reference or citation, it is considered plagiarism.  Examples of plagiarism range from small infractions such as not putting quotes around a quotation to blatant violations such as copying an entire website.  Even if the original content has been modified, such as an altered image or a reworded article, it is still considered plagiarism if no credit is given to the original source.\nWe live in a time when most information is available in a digital format.  While this makes it easier to access information than ever before, it also makes it easier to plagiarize other people's work.  All it takes is a simple copy operation to copy large amounts of text or images from another source.  This content can be pasted into a document or another publication in a matter of seconds.  Anyone with a website can potentially republish the content for the whole world to see, without citing the original author.\nBecause it is so easy to copy and paste digital information, plagiarism in the information age has become a serious problem.  Fortunately, there are laws in place to protect against plagiarism.  The most notable is international copyright law, which states that each individual's published work is automatically protected by copyright.  This means others cannot copy the work without the author's approval and can be held liable for breaking the law if they do so.  In 1996, the U.S. Senate passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which heightened penalties for copyright infringements on the Internet.\nAvoiding plagiarism is easy.  It comes down to doing what's right.  If you use someone else's information, make sure you cite the source.  When writing a paper, this means adding APA or MLA citations when you reference other publications.   When publishing a website, it means adding a reference and a link to the website where the information is from.  If you need to reference a large amount of content from another source, you should contact the author and ask for permission.  That way, you can make sure you use and reference the information appropriately.\nFor information about citing content from TechTerms.com, please view the Citation Guidelines."

Therefore you cannot apply bold, italic, or underlined styles, and you cannot use different fonts or font sizes in a plain text document.\nBecause plain text does not contain information about text sizes or styles, it is the most efficient way to store text.  Plain text documents often take up less than half the size of rich text documents containing the same number of characters.  This is why log files, which contain a \"log\" of data generated by a program, are typically stored in a plain text format.\nYou can use a basic text editor such as Notepad or WordPad (for Windows) or TextEdit (for Mac) to create a plain text document.  Other word processing programs can also create plain text documents, but you may have to use the \"Save As...\" command and choose the plain text option when saving the file.  Keep in mind that if you change a rich text document to a plain text file, you will lose any formatting applied to the text.\nSince converting rich text to plain text removes text formatting, this process can be used to strip all styles from formatted text.  For example, if you use Windows, you can copy text from a formatted document and paste it into Notepad, which only supports plain text.  If you copy the text you just pasted into Notepad, the unformatted text will be copied to your clipboard.  The next time you paste the text, it will be pasted as plain text.

Pop-Up Menu\nA pop-up menu is a type of menu that pops up on the screen when the user right-clicks a certain object or area.  It can be also called a contextual menu since the menu options are relevant to where the user right-clicked on the screen.  Pop-up menus provide quick access to common program functions and are used by most operating systems and applications."

            "In the computer world, the term \"port\" has three different meanings.  It may refer to 1) a hardware port, 2) an Internet port number, or 3) the process of porting a software program from one platform to another.\n1. Hardware Port\nA hardware port is a physical connection on a computer or another electronic device.  Common ports on modern desktop computers include USB, Thunderbolt, Ethernet, and DisplayPort.  Previous generations of computers used different ports, such a serial ports, parallel ports, and VGA ports.  Mobile devices often have only one port.  For example, an iPhone or iPad may have a single Lightning connector.  Android devices often have a USB-C port.\nThe purpose of a hardware port is to provide connectivity and\/or electrical power to a device.  For example, the USB ports on a computer can be used to connect keyboards, mice, printers, or other peripherals.  The USB-C port on a smartphone may be used to charge the device and sync it with a PC.\nNOTE: A hardware port may also be called an interface, jack, or connector.\n2. Internet Port Number\nAll data transmitted over the internet is sent and received using a specific set of commands, also known as a protocol.  Each protocol is assigned a specific port number.  For example, all website data transferred over HTTP uses port 80.  Data sent over HTTPS uses port 443.  Other common ports include:\n\nPort 20 - FTP (file transfer protocol)\nPort 22 - SSH and SFTP\nPort 25 - SMTP (outgoing email)\nPort 465 - SMTP over SSL\nPort 143 - IMAP (incoming email)\nPort 993 - IMAP over SSL\n\nPort numbers are similar to wireless channels in that they prevent conflicts between different protocols.  They also provide a simple way to implement network security measures, since it is possible to allow or block specific protocols.\n3. Porting Software\n\"Port\" may also be used as a verb.  Porting software means taking an application written for one platform and making it work on another one.  For example, a Windows program may be ported to macOS.  An iOS app may be ported to Android.\nIn order to port a program from one platform to another, it must be written for the corresponding hardware and operating system.  Programs built using a universal development environment may be relatively easy to port, while programs that rely heavily on an operating system's API may have to be completely rewritten."

It does not need to be installed on a computer to run and does not store data on the host system.  Instead, all user settings and related files are stored on the removable drive.\nPortable software can refer to 1) individual portable applications or 2) portable software platforms.\n1. Individual portable applications\nApplications that run from external media without requiring installation are considered portable apps.  For example, LibreOffice and OpenOffice are both available in \"portable\" versions that can be run from a flash drive.  Examples of other portable apps include Blender Portable \u2013 a 3D modeling application, Eclipse Portable \u2013 a software IDE, and Media Player Classic Portable \u2013 a media playback program.  All of these programs are available in both standard and portable versions.\n2. Portable software platforms\nSince there are many portable applications available, it is common to include multiple apps on one removable drive, managed by a single portable platform.  By consolidating all your portable apps on one device, you can bring your desktop applications \u2013 along with all your files and settings \u2013 with you wherever you go.  The most popular portable platform is PortableApps.com, which supports over 300 portable applications.  Other portable platforms include Ceedo, winPenPack, and SmartKey, the successor to the U3 platform developed by SanDisk.\nThe main benefit of portable software is that you can run applications on any compatible machine.  However, it also provides a security benefit since all your settings are stored on the removable storage device.  This provides a means of \"sandboxing,\" which prevents unwanted files or malware from being written to your device."

            "Web portals come in two flavors \u2014 internal an external.  Internal portals are designed to provide services within an organization, while external portals serve as a starting point for browsing the web.\nInternal Portal\nMany businesses have a company portal, which is a website designed to provide communication and services to employees.  For example, it may include a calendar of events, such as meetings, product releases, and other important dates.  It may also provide links to employee documents, such as the employee handbook, tax forms, and FAQs for common job-related questions.  Company portals often include a way for employees to communicate with each other, either through live messaging or email.\nInternal portals often exist within an intranet, which is a private network.  This means only authorized users can access the portal.  In most cases, you must enter valid login information in order to use an internal portal.  While some portal services are installed within a local network, others are hosted by remote servers.  Remotely hosted portals may not offer as much customization as locally installed ones, but they also require less maintenance.  Both types of portals can be accessed with a standard web browser.\nExternal Portal\nAn external portal is a website designed to be a starting point on the web.  It consolidates links to different subjects and related articles, simplifying the web browsing process.  Yahoo, for example, is a well-known portal that includes categories such as News, Sports, Finance, Shopping, Movies, Politics, Tech, and others.  Each of these topics include links to news stories, both internal and external, to Yahoo! that you can read.\nIn the early days of the Internet, portals were a common way for people to browse the web.  However, as search engine technology improved in the late 1990s, people starting using search engines more and portals less.  As a result, web portals have faded in popularity over the past few decades and only a few remain.\nNOTE: A portal is different than a search engine, but most portals include some type of search feature.  Yahoo! is both a portal and a search engine, since it includes a comprehensive web search capability.  Google is primarily a search engine and was not originally designed to be a portal.  However, since Google now provides services like YouTube, Google Maps, Google Drive, Gmail, News, and others from the Google home page, it is also a portal."

It can be used to define the appearance of graphics and text for both screen and print.  The language was developed by Adobe in 1984 and has since gone through many revisions and updates.\nBefore PostScript was introduced, publishing systems relied on proprietary typesetting systems, which often caused incompatibilities between computers and printing systems.  In fact, before the days of PostScript, pages that incorporated text, images, and line art had to be manually assembled on a paste-up board and then photographed.  The resulting picture was sent to a printing plate, which was used to make copies of the document -- pretty archaic compared to the simple printing options available today.\nAdobe PostScript makes it possible to produce high quality page content that can include text, images, and line art in a standard format compatible with multiple devices.  For example, PostScript (.PS) files will print the exact same way from different PostScript compatible printers.  They can also be opened using Adobe Acrobat and will look the same on Macintosh and Windows platforms.

In simple terms, to power cycle a device means to turn it off and turn it back on again.  For example, the user manual of a router may ask you to power cycle the router if it stops responding.   This may mean switching the power to OFF and then ON again or may require physically unplugging the device and then plugging it back in again.  Power cycling is often synonymous with resetting a device.\nAs we all know, computer equipment can be rather finicky at times.  A device that was working fine ten minutes ago may begin acting strangely or may not be responding at all.  Often the low-tech solution of simply turning off the device and turning it back on again will fix the problem.  This is because information stored in the device's RAM may have gotten corrupted and caused the device to hang up or stall on a certain instruction.  Power cycling the device erases the RAM and allows it to boot up with fresh information.  Typically it is a good idea to wait 5 to 10 seconds before turning the device back on to make sure it has chance to fully reset.  Of course, if you need to power cycle your computer, you should save any work you currently have open, since it will be erased from the RAM once the system is restarted."

It receives power from an electrical outlet and converts the current from AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current), which is what the computer requires.  It also regulates the voltage to an adequate amount, which allows the computer to run smoothly without overheating.  The power supply an integral part of any computer and must function correctly for the rest of the components to work.\nYou can locate the power supply on a system unit by simply finding the input where the power cord is plugged in.  Without opening your computer, this is typically the only part of the power supply you will see.  If you were to remove the power supply, it would look like a metal box with a fan inside and some cables attached to it.  Of course, you should never have to remove the power supply, so it's best to leave it in the case.\nWhile most computers have internal power supplies, many electronic devices use external ones.  For example, some monitors and external hard drives have power supplies that reside outside the main unit.  These power supplies are connected directly to the cable that plugs into the wall.  They often include another cable that connects the device to the power supply.  Some power supplies, often called \"AC adaptors,\" are connected directly to the plug (which can make them difficult to plug in where space is limited).  Both of these designs allow the main device to be smaller or sleeker by moving the power supply outside the unit.\nSince the power supply is the first place an electronic device receives electricity, it is also the most vulnerable to power surges and spikes.  Therefore, power supplies are designed to handle fluctuations in electrical current and still provide a regulated or consistent power output.  Some include fuses that will blow if the surge is too great, protecting the rest of the equipment.  After all, it is much cheaper to replace a power supply than an entire computer.  Still, it is wise to connect all electronics to a surge protector or UPS to keep them from being damaged by electrical surges."

The presentations are comprised of slides, which may contain text, images, and other media, such as audio clips and movies.  Sound effects and animated transitions can also be included to add extra appeal to the presentation.  However, overusing sound effects and transitions will probably do more to annoy your audience than draw their attention.  (Yes, we have all heard the car screeching noise enough times for one lifetime.)\nMost PowerPoint presentations are created from a template, which includes a background color or image, a standard font, and a choice of several slide layouts.  Changes to the template can be saved to a \"master slide,\" which stores the main slide theme used in the presentation.  When changes are made to the master slide, such as choosing a new background image, the changes are propagated to all the other slides.  This keeps a uniform look among all the slides in the presentation.\nWhen presenting a PowerPoint presentation, the presenter may choose to have the slides change at preset intervals or may decide to control the flow manually.  This can be done using the mouse, keyboard, or a remote control.  The flow of the presentation can be further customized by having slides load completely or one bullet at a time.  For example, if the presenter has several bullet points on a page, he might have individual points appear when he clicks the mouse.  This allows more interactivity with the audience and brings greater focus to each point.\nPowerPoint presentations can be created and viewed using Microsoft PowerPoint.  They can also be imported and exported with Apple Keynote, Apple's presentation program for the Macintosh platform.  Since most people prefer not to watch presentations on a laptop, PowerPoint presentations are often displayed using a projector.

For example, a hard drive may be tested in extremely hot and cold temperatures to determine what the safe operating temperature of the hard drive is.  A chip manufacturer may test a CPU under a maximum processing load for an extended period of time to make sure it does not overheat.  Hard drives, CPUs, and RAM are all tested for reliability, since small errors can cause major problems.  Modern computers can perform billions of calculations per second, so even one miscalculation per billion is considered highly unreliable.\nSoftware is also pretested before it is made available for sale.  The amount of pretesting is generally determined by the size and complexity of the program.  Initially, pretesting is done by the software development team, as the initial bugs are worked out.  Then the software may go through an \"alpha\" phase, where the developers and possibly other users test the software.

For example, if a database contains definitions of computer terms, it would make sense that each term is only listed once in the database.  By defining the \"Term\" field as the primary key, it would ensure that no term is listed more than once in the database.\nWhile a table's primary key is usually assigned to a specific field, it can also be comprised of multiple values.  For example, a database of news articles might use both the title and date fields to uniquely identify each entry.  By combining the \"Title\" and \"Date\" fields as the primary key, it would ensure no entries have the same title on the same day.\nIf multiple fields in a table cannot have duplicate values, most database management system (DBMS) also allow fields to be defined as \"Unique.\"  This is similar to setting a field as the primary key, but is not exactly the same thing.  The primary key also acts as a pointer to the record and provides a simple way for the DBMS to search, sort, and access the records.  It also helps relate records across multiple tables. Therefore, while multiple fields within a table can be defined as \"Unique,\" each table can only have one primary key.

The Processing window is actually a Java program called PApplet, which is a Java class.  Before Processing 3 was released (in 2015), it was possible to embed a PApplet into a Java application.  The applet dependency was removed in Processing 3.0, so extra code is now required to embed PApplets into Java applications.\nWhile the Processing IDE is the standard way to create and run Processing sketches, they can also be built and run using other interfaces.  For example, it is possible to use an IDE like Eclipse as long as Processing's core.jar file is imported.  It is also possible to run Processing sketches directly in a web browser using the p5.js JavaScript library.  Finally, there is a Processing.py library that allows Processing programs to be written and run in Python."

            "A processor, or \"microprocessor,\" is a small chip that resides in computers and other electronic devices.  Its basic job is to receive input and provide the appropriate output.  While this may seem like a simple task, modern processors can handle trillions of calculations per second.\nThe central processor of a computer is also known as the CPU, or \"central processing unit.\"  This processor handles all the basic system instructions, such as processing mouse and keyboard input and running applications.  Most desktop computers contain a CPU developed by either Intel or AMD, both of which use the x86 processor architecture.  Mobile devices, such as laptops and tablets may use Intel and AMD CPUs, but can also use specific mobile processors developed by companies like ARM or Apple.\nModern CPUs often include multiple processing cores, which work together to process instructions.  While these \"cores\" are contained in one physical unit, they are actually individual processors.  In fact, if you view your computer's performance with a system monitoring utility like Windows Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac OS X), you will see separate graphs for each processor.  Processors that include two cores are called dual-core processors, while those with four cores are called quad-core processors.  Some high-end workstations contain multiple CPUs with multiple cores, allowing a single machine to have eight, twelve, or even more processing cores.\nBesides the central processing unit, most desktop and laptop computers also include a GPU.  This processor is specifically designed for rendering graphics that are output on a monitor.  Desktop computers often have a video card that contains the GPU, while mobile devices usually contain a graphics chip that is integrated into the motherboard.  By using separate processors for system and graphics processing, computers are able to handle graphic-intensive applications more efficiently."

Many computers today have multi-core processors, meaning the CPU contains more than one core.\nFor many years, computer CPUs only had a single core.  In the early 2000s, as processor clock speeds began plateauing, CPU manufacturers needed to find other ways to increase processing performance.  Initially, they achieved this by putting multiple processors in high-end computers.  While this was effective, it added significant cost to the computers and the multiprocessing performance was limited by the bus speed between the CPUs.\nBy combining processors on a single chip, CPU manufactures were able to increase performance more efficiently at a lower cost.  The individual processing units became known as \u201ccores\u201d rather than processors.  In the mid-2000s, dual-core and quad-core CPUs began replacing multi-processor configurations.  While initially only high-end computers contained multiple cores, today nearly all PCs have multi-core processors.\nNOTE: \u201cCore\u201d is also the name of Intel\u2019s processor line, which replaced the Pentium lineup in 2006.  Examples of Intel Core processors include the Core Duo, Core 2, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7."

            "Program is a common computer term that can be used as both a noun and a verb.  A program (noun) is executable software that runs on a computer.  It is similar to a script, but is often much larger in size and does not require a scripting engine to run.  Instead, a program consists of compiled code that can run directly from the computer's operating system.\nExamples of programs include Web browsers, word processors, e-mail clients, video games, and system utilities.  These programs are often called applications, which can be used synonymously with \"software programs.\"  On Windows, programs typically have an .EXE file extension, while Macintosh programs have an .APP extension.\nWhen \"program\" is used as verb, it means to create a software program.  For example, programmers create programs by writing code that instructs the computer what to do.  The functions and commands written by the programmer are collectively referred to as source code.  When the code is finished, the source code file or files are compiled into an executable program."

Languages that programmers use to write code are called \"high-level languages.\"  This code can be compiled into a \"low-level language,\" which is recognized directly by the computer hardware.\nHigh-level languages are designed to be easy to read and understand.  This allows programmers to write source code in a natural fashion, using logical words and symbols.  For example, reserved words like function, while, if, and else are used in most major programming languages.  Symbols like &lt;, &gt;, ==, and != are common operators.  Many high-level languages are similar enough that programmers can easily understand source code written in multiple languages.  \nExamples of high-level languages include C++, Java, Perl, and PHP.  Languages like C++ and Java are called \"compiled languages\" since the source code must first be compiled in order to run.  Languages like Perl and PHP are called \"interpreted languages\" since the source code can be run through an interpreter without being compiled.  Generally, compiled languages are used to create software applications, while interpreted languages are used for running scripts, such as those used to generate content for dynamic websites.\nLow-level languages include assembly and machine languages.  An assembly language contains a list of basic instructions and is much more difficult to read than a high-level language.  In rare cases, a programmer may decide to code a basic program in an assembly language to ensure it operates as efficiently as possible.  An assembler can be used to translate the assembly code into machine code.  The machine code, or machine language, contains a series of binary codes that are understood directly by a computer's CPU.  Needless to say, machine language is not designed to be human readable."

            "Video signals are generated using horizontal lines.  An interlaced picture draws every other line and alternates between drawing odd lines and even lines.  A progressive scan picture draws every line in sequence.  Therefore, a progressive scan video signal sends twice as much data than an interlaced signal each time it draws an image on the screen.\nBefore DVDs and HDTV became popular, interlaced video was the norm for television.  Standard definition broadcasts were interlaced, since it was a more efficient way to send video data.  Since the human eye has a hard time detecting video interlacing, an interlaced signal that refreshes at 60 Hz (times per second) is easier on the eyes and produces less flicker than a progressive scan signal that refreshes at 30 Hz.\nStill, if a progressive scan and interlaced image are both projected at 60 Hz, the progressive scan image will usually appear slightly smoother.  Video that contains fast motion makes this difference more noticeable.  For this reason, the DVD and HDTV standards were developed to support progressive scan video signals.\nWhen you see video formats described as 480p or 720p, the number indicates how many horizontal lines of resolution the video signal uses, while the \"p\" indicates it is a progressive scan signal.  Similarly, the 1080i format contains 1080 lines of resolution, but is interlaced.  Both 720p and 1080i are used by HDTV."

They can be mounted on ceilings or may be freestanding and portable.  Ceiling-mounted projectors are typically larger, especially ones that project a long distance (such as 30 feet or more).  These projectors are commonly found in classrooms, conference rooms, auditoriums, and places of worship.\nPortable projectors can used wherever there is a bright surface (such as a white or light colored wall).  Most projectors have multiple input sources, such as HDMI ports for newer equipment and VGA ports for older devices.  Some projectors support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as well.\nHigh-quality projectors used to cost thousands of dollars and the bulbs alone could cost more than a hundred dollars.  Modern advances in technology \u2013 especially LCD and LED light sources \u2013 have reduced the cost of a bright high-quality projector to only a few hundred dollars.  \nFront vs Rear Projection\nMost projectors can be used for either front or rear projection.  The difference is the screen, which is opaque white for front projection and semi-transparent grey for rear projection.  Front projection sends the image from the position of the audience to the front of the screen.  This is by far the most common method since it does not require an empty space behind the screen.\nRear projection projects the image towards the audience from behind the screen.  This method is less affected by ambient light and often provides better contrast.  Rear projection is commonly used in outdoor settings and commercial areas where space is not an issue."

In the computing world, proprietary is often used to describe software that is not open source or freely licensed.  Examples include operating systems, software programs, and file formats.\n1. Operating Systems\nProprietary operating systems cannot be modified by users or other companies.  For example, Windows and OS X are both proprietary OSes.  The Windows source code is owned by Microsoft and the OS X source code is owned by Apple.  Other companies can make programs that run on these operating systems, but they cannot modify the OS itself.  Linux and Android are not proprietary, which is why many different versions of these operating systems exist.\n2. Software Programs\nProprietary software programs are applications in which all rights are retained by the developer or publisher.  They are typically closed-source, meaning the developer does not provide the source code to anyone outside the company.  Proprietary programs are licensed to end users under specific terms defined by the developer or publisher.  These terms often restrict the usage, distribution, and modification of the software.  Most commercial software is proprietary because it gives the developer a competitive advantage.\n3. File Formats\nSome file types are saved in a proprietary file format that can only be recognized by a specific program.  These file types are typically created by proprietary software programs and are usually saved in a binary (rather than a text-based) format.  By storing data in a proprietary format, developers can ensure that files created with their software cannot be opened with other software programs.  Proprietary file types saved by software programs are also called native files."

            "A protocol is a standard set of rules that allow electronic devices to communicate with each other.  These rules include what type of data may be transmitted, what commands are used to send and receive data, and how data transfers are confirmed.\nYou can think of a protocol as a spoken language.  Each language has its own rules and vocabulary.  If two people share the same language, they can communicate effectively.  Similarly, if two hardware devices support the same protocol, they can communicate with each other, regardless of the manufacturer or type of device.  For example, an Apple iPhone can send an email to an Android device using a standard mail protocol.  A Windows-based PC can load a webpage from a Unix-based web server using a standard web protocol.\nProtocols exist for several different applications.  Examples include wired networking (e.g., Ethernet), wireless networking (e.g.,  802.11ac), and Internet communication (e.g., IP).  The Internet protocol suite, which is used for transmitting data over the Internet, contains dozens of protocols.  These protocols may be broken up into four catagories:\n\nLink layer - PPP, DSL, Wi-Fi, etc.\nInternet layer - IPv4, IPv6, etc.\nTransport layer - TCP, UDP, etc.\nApplication layer - HTTP, IMAP, FTP, etc.\n\nLink layer protocols establish communication between devices at a hardware level.  In order to transmit data from one device to another, each device's hardware must support the same link layer protocol. Internet layer protocols are used to initiate data transfers and route them over the Internet.  Transport layer protocols define how packets are sent, received, and confirmed.  Application layer protocols contain commands for specific applications.  For example, a web browser uses HTTPS to securely download the contents of a webpage from a web server.  An email client uses SMTP to send email messages through a mail server.\nProtocols are a fundamental aspect of digital communication.  In most cases, protocols operate in the background, so it is not necessary for typical users to know how each protocol works.  Still, it may be helpful to familiarize yourself with some common protocols so you can better understand settings in software programs, such as web browsers and email clients."

This is a server that all computers on the local network have to go through before accessing information on the Internet.  By using a proxy server, an organization can improve the network performance and filter what users connected to the network can access.\nA proxy server improves Internet access speeds from a network primarily by using a caching system.  Caching saves recently viewed Web sites, images, and files on a local hard drive so that they don't have to be downloaded from the Web again.  While your Web browser might save recently viewed items on your computer, a proxy server caches everything accessed from the network.  That means if Bob views a news story at cnn.com at 1:00 and Jill views the same page at 1:03, she'll most likely get the page straight from the proxy server's cache.  Though this means super-fast access to Web pages, it also means users might not be seeing the latest update of each Web page.\nThe other main purpose a proxy server is to filter what is allowed into the network.  While HTTP, FTP, and Secure protocols can all be filtered by a proxy server, HTTP is the most common.  The proxy server can limit what Web sites users on the network can access.  Many organizations choose to block access to sites with objectionable material such as hacking information and pornography, but other sites can be filtered as well.  If an employer notices workers are spending too much time at sites like eBay or Quicken.com, those sites can be blocked by the proxy server as well."

It does not require strict syntax, but instead serves as a general representation of a program's functions.\nSince each programming language uses a unique syntax structure, understanding the code of multiple languages can be difficult.  Pseudocode remedies this problem by using conventional syntax and basic english phrases that are universally understood.  For example, a line of PHP code may read:if ($i < 10) { i++; } \nThis could be written in pseudocode as:if i is less than 10, increment i by 1.\nBy describing a program in pseudocode, programmers of all types of languages can understand the function of a program.\nPseudocode is an informal language, so it is mainly used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program.
