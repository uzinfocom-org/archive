It is uni-directional (one-way) and supports uncompressed stereo audio and compressed surround sound audio.\nA S\/PDIF audio signal may be transmitted over coaxial or fiber optic cable.  Coax transmissions use RCA connectors, while optical transmissions use Toslink connectors.  Regardless of the transfer medium, a S\/PDIF signal is always digital, not analog.\nSince S\/PDIF supports multiple types of connections, S\/PDIF ports on AVRs and other devices may not be uniform.  Most modern devices that support S\/PDIF provide an optical Toslink connection.\nS\/PDIF supports uncompressed 2-channel (stereo) audio, making it an ideal interface for CD players, turntables, and other stereo audio devices.  While S\/PDIF supports surround sound signals, it does not have enough bandwidth to transmit more than two channels of uncompressed digital audio.  Therefore, S\/PDIF must transfer 5.1 and 7.2 surround sound audio in a compressed format, such as Dolby Digital.  Specifically:\nS\/PDIF Supports:\n\n2-channel uncompresed 16-bit, 44.1 kilohertz stereo audio\nCompressed surround sound audio (Dolby Digital, DD+, and DTS)\n\nS\/PDIF Does Not Support:\n\nMore than two channels of uncompressed audio\nUncompressed surround sound audio (Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio)\n\nUncompressed surround sound audio requires a high-bandwidth digital connection, such as HDMI or ADAT."

This allows individual hard drives to be used by multiple computers, making it easy to share information between different machines.\nWhile a single server can provide a shared hard drive to multiple machines, large networks may require more storage than a single server can offer.  For example, a large business may have several terabytes of data that needs to be accessible by multiple machines on a local area network (LAN).  In this situation, a SAN could be setup instead of adding additional servers.

SATA transfer rates start at 150MBps, which is significantly faster than even the fastest 100MBps ATA\/100 drives.  For this and other reasons, Serial ATA is likely to replace the previous standard, Parallel ATA (PATA), which has been around since the 1980s.\nBesides faster transfer rates, the SATA interface has several advantages over the PATA interface.  For one, SATA drives each have their own independent bus, so there is no competition for bandwidth like there is with Parallel ATA.  They also use smaller, thinner cables, which allows for better airflow inside the computer.  SATA cables can be as long as one meter, while PATA cables max out at 40cm.  This gives manufacturers more liberty when designing the internal layout of their computers.  Finally, Serial ATA uses only 7 conductors, while Parallel ATA uses 40.  This means there is less likely to be electromagnetic interference with SATA devices.\nIn summary, Serial ATA is a better, more efficient interface than the dated PATA standard.  If you are looking to buy a computer that will support fast hard drives for years to come, make sure it comes with a SATA interface."

Examples include digital cameras, video recorders, smartphones, and portable music players.  SD cards are considered removable storage (instead of internal or external storage), since they can be inserted and removed from a compatible device.\nThe first SD cards were introduced in 1999.  They used almost the same form factor as the existing MultiMediaCard (MMC) format, but were slightly thicker (2.1 mm vs 1.4 mm).   The dimensions of a standard SD card are:\n\n24 mm wide\n32 mm tall\n2.1 mm thick\n\nEach SD card has a slanted upper-right corner to ensure the card can only be inserted one way.  The left side of a card has a physical slider that prevents the card from being written (read-only) when moved to the LOCK position.  The \"secure\" part of \"Secure Digital\" refers to its built-in DRM protection technology.  The SD format supports Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), which prevents protected content from being read from another storage device.\nSince its introduction in 1999, the SD card format has gone through several iterations.  Below are different versions of SD, listed with their storage capacity and maximum data transfer rate.\n\nSD - 2 GB capacity, 12.5 MB\/sec\nSDHC - 32 GB capacity, 25 MB\/sec\nSDXC - 2 TB capacity, 312 MB\/sec\nSDUC - 128 TB capacity, 985 MB\/sec\n\nAnother version of SD, called microSD, was introduced in 2005.  microSD cards are much smaller than SD cards, with dimensions of 11 mm x 15 mm x 1mm.  Small devices like GoPros and smartphones have microSD slots to reduce the overall device size as much as possible.  microSD cards can be used in standard SD card slots using a microSD-to-SD adapter."

It can be applied to networks and online services, but is most often used in software development.\nWhen applied to software, the SDLC is also called the \"application development life-cycle.\"  Some SDLC models have as few as five stages, while others have as many as ten.  A typical SDLC framework used for developing a software application might include the following seven stages:\n\nPlanning - The most fundamental part of the SDLC is planning.  This includes steps like determining a need for a specific program, who will be the end users, what the development will cost, and how long it will take.\nDefining - In this stage, the general development plan is funneled into specific criteria.  The specific requirements of the program are defined.  At this stage, the development team may also decide what programming language should be used to build the program.\nDesigning - This process involves creating the user interface and determining how the program will function.  For larger applications, it is common to create a design document specification (DDS), which may need to be reviewed and approved before the actual development begins.\nBuilding - The building stage typically comprises the bulk of the software development process.  It includes programming the source code, creating the graphics, and compiling the assets into an executable program.  Small projects may involve a single programmer, while larger projects may include multiple teams working together.  For example, one team might design the user interface, while another team writes the source code.  For multiplatform applications, individual teams may be assigned to different platforms.\nTesting - The all-important testing phase allows the developer to catch unknown issues and fix any bugs that arise in the program.  Some testing may be done internally, while a beta version of the software might be provided to a select group of users for public testing.\nDeployment - Once a program has passed the testing phase, it is ready for deployment.  In this stage, the software is released to the public.  It may be provided via an electronic download or as boxed software, which comes on a CD or DVD.\nMaintenance - After a software application has been released, there may still be additional bugs or feature requests submitted by users.  The development team must maintain the software by fixing bugs and adding new features.  Commercial software programs often include some level of technical support.\n\nThe reason the above stages are referred to as a cycle is because these stages are repeated each time a new major version of the software is released.  While the maintenance stage may encompass minor updates, most software companies stay in business by regularly releasing paid updates (version 2, version 3, etc).  Before embarking on a new major version, the development team must first create a plan (stage 1) and then continue through the other stages of the SDLC."

He wants his site to show up in the top few listings when someone searches for \"soccer shoes.\"  Then he gets more leads from search engines, which means more traffic, more sales, and more revenue.  The problem is that there are thousands of other soccer sites, whose Webmasters are hoping for the same thing.  That's where search engine optimization, or SEO, comes in.\nSEO involves a number of adjustments to the HTML of individual Web pages to achieve a high search engine ranking.  First, the title of the page must include relevant information about the page.  In the previous example, Bob's home page might have the title, \"Bob's Soccer Store -- Soccer Shoes and Equipment.\"  The title is the most important part of SEO, since it tells the search engine exactly what the page is about.  Within Bob's home page, it would be helpful to repeat the words \"soccer\" and \"soccer shoes\" a few times, since search engines also scan the text of the pages they index.\nFinally, there are META tags.  These HTML tags can really distinguish your site from the rest of the pile.  The META tags that most search engines read are the description and keywords tags.  Within the description tags, you should type a brief description of the Web page.  It should be similar but more detailed than the title.  Within the keywords tags, you should list 5-20 words that relate to the content of the page.  Using META tags can significantly boost your search engine ranking.\nSo what happens when a bunch of sites all have similar titles, content, and META tags?  Well, most search engines choose to list the most popular sites first.  But then how do you get into the most popular sites?  The best way is to submit your site to Web directories (not just search engines) and get other sites to link to yours.  It can be a long climb to the top, but your perseverance will pay off."

For example, the INVITE request message is used to invite a user to begin a session and ACK confirms the user has received the request.  The response code 180 (Ringing) means the user is being alerted of the call and 200 (OK) indicates the request was successful.  Once a session has been established, BYE is used to end the communication.

Since social networking websites already have large established online communities, businesses and organizations can gain exposure by simply joining these websites.  Organizations can create custom social media profiles, then build their own communities within these sites by adding users as friends or followers.  Many companies attract users by posting frequent updates and providing special offers through their social media profile pages.\nWhile SMM is a powerful online marketing tool, it is typically used to supplement other online marketing methods rather than replace them.  Since just about any company or business and join a social networking website, it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd.  Therefore, most companies still rely on Web advertising and search engine optimization SEO to generate traffic to the their websites."

It is sometimes contrasted with asymmetric multiprocessing, which delegates each processor to a specific task.\nThe vast majority of computers with multiple processors (or processing cores) support SMP.  It is implemented at the operating system level, which distributes computing tasks across two or more processors.  Modern OSes, such as Windows, macOS, and Unix have supported SMP since the late 1990s.\nMost software applications benefit automatically from SMP, thanks to the underlying OS support.  However, developers may still optimize apps to use multiple processors even more effectively.  For example, a video editing program might send specific rendering operations to different processors, which may be more efficient than letting the OS balance the processing load.\nHow SMP Works\nSMP requires multiple homogenous processors, meaning each processor has the same architecture and clock speed.  All processors share the same system bus and system memory, so no processor is prioritized over the others.  The OS distributes computing operations across the processors (or processing cores), attempting to use them all equally.\nSMP can substantially improve a computer's performance compared to a single-processor system.  However, since individual threads are sent to different processors, there is overhead in distributing the tasks.  Additionally, not all computing operations can be split across multiple processors.  Therefore, SMP does not increase performance by 100% for each additional processor."

Internal SSDs connect to a computer like a hard drive, using standard IDE or SATA connections.\nWhile SSDs serve the same function as hard drives, their internal components are much different.  Unlike hard drives, SSDs do not have any moving parts (which is why they are called solid state drives).  Instead of storing data on magnetic platters, SSDs store data using flash memory.  Since SSDs have no moving parts, they don't have to \"spin up\" while in a sleep state and they don't need to move a drive head to different parts of the drive to access data.  Therefore, SSDs can access data faster than HDDs.\nSSDs have several other advantages over hard drives as well.  For example, the read performance of a hard drive declines when data gets fragmented, or split up into multiple locations on the disk.  The read performance of an SSD does not diminish based on where data is stored on the drive.  Therefore defragmenting an SSD is not necessary.  Since SSDs do not store data magnetically, they are not susceptible to data loss due to strong magnetic fields in close proximity to the drive.  Additionally, since SSDs have no moving parts, there is far less chance of a mechanical breakdown.  SSDs are also lighter, quieter, and use less power than hard drives.  This is why SSDs have become a popular choice for laptop computers.\nWhile SSDs have many advantages over HDDs, they also have some drawbacks.  Since the SSD technology is much newer than traditional hard drive technology, the price of SSDs is substantially higher.  As of early 2011, SSDs cost about 10 times as much per gigabyte as a hard drive.  Therefore, most SSD drives sold today have much smaller capacities than comparable hard drives.  They also have a limited number or write cycles, which may cause their performance to degrade over time.  Fortunately, newer SSDs have improved reliability and should last several years before any reduction in performance is noticeable.

This includes sharing files and using shared devices such as printers connected to other computers within the local network.\nBecause SMB was developed only for Windows, without Samba, other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, even if they were part of the same network.  Fortunately, Samba helps different types of computers work together as if they were all based on the same platform.  This gives network administrators the freedom to choose multiple types of computers systems when setting up a network.  Now that's a reason to dance!"

            "A sample is a digital representation of an analog signal.  Both digital video and digital audio files are created using samples.  The quality of the sample is determined by the sampling rate, or the bit rate the signal is sampled at.\nWhat we see and hear in the real world is in analog format (our bodies process analog information).  Computers, on the other hand, can only understand digital information.  Therefore, audio and video signals must be converted to a digital format in order to be stored on a computer or saved to a CD or DVD.  The converted data is called a sample.\nThe term \"sample\" is often used to refer to short audio clips used for playing back sounds.  For example, a violin sound or a bird chirp may be sampled and then played back from a digital keyboard (or synthesizer).  However, samples can refer to entire songs or movies, since the information is technically one long sample.  To learn more about how samples are created, view the definition of sampling, which is the process of recording and creating digital samples."

            "In audio production, a sample rate (or \"sampling rate\") defines how many times per second a sound is sampled.  Technically speaking, it is the frequency of samples used in a digital recording.\nThe standard sample rate used for audio CDs is 44.1 kilohertz (44,100 hertz).  That means each second of a song on a CD contains 44,100 individual samples.  When an analog sound, such as a vocal performance, is sampled at a rate of tens of thousands of times per second, the digital recording may be nearly indistinguishable from the original analog sound.\nCDs use a sample rate of 44.1 KHz because it allows for a maximum audio frequency of 22.05 kilohertz.  The human ear can detect sounds from roughly 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz, so there is little reason to record at higher sample rates.  However, because digital audio recordings are estimations of analog audio, a smoother sound can be gained by increasing the sample rate above 44.1 KHz.  Examples of high sample rates include 48 KHz (used for DVD video), 88.2 KHz (2x the rate of CD audio), and 96 KHz (used for DVD-Audio and other high definition audio formats).\nWhile audio aficionados may appreciate higher sample rates, it is difficult for most people to perceive an improvement in audio quality when the sample rate is higher than 44.1 Khz.  A more effective way to improve the quality of digital audio is to increase the bit depth, which determines amplitude range of each sample.  16-bit audio, used in audio CDs, provides 216 or 65,536 possible amplitude values.  24-bit audio, used in high definition formats, can store 224 or 16,777,216 possible amplitude values \u2013 256 times more than 16-bit audio.\nNOTE: Many DAW programs support sample rates up to 192 KHz.  Recording at extremely high sample rates allows sound engineers to preserve the audio quality during the mixing and editing process.  This can improve the end result of a song or audio clip even if the final version is saved with a sample rate of 44.1 Hz."

            "Before digital recording took over the audio and video industries, everything was recorded in analog.  Audio was recorded to devices like cassette tapes and records.  Video was recorded to Beta and VHS tapes.  The media was even edited in analog format, using multichannel audio tapes (such as 8-tracks) for music, and film reels for video recordings.  This method involved a lot of rewinding and fast-forwarding, which resulted in a time-consuming process.\nFortunately, digital recording has now almost completely replaced analog recording.  Digital editing can be done much more efficiently than analog editing and the media does not lose any quality in the process.  However, since what humans see and hear is in analog format (linear waves of light and sound), saving audio and video in a digital format requires converting the signal from analog to digital.  This process is called sampling.\nSampling involves taking snapshots of an audio or video signal at very fast intervals, usually tens of thousands of times per second.  The quality of the digital signal is determined largely by the sampling rate, or the bit rate the signal is sampled at.  The higher the bit rate, the more samples are created per second, and the more realistic the resulting audio or video file will be.  For example, CD-quality audio is sampled at 44.1 kHz, or 44,100 samples per second.  The difference between a 44.1 kHz digital recording and the original audio signal is imperceptible to most people.  However, if the audio was recorded at 22 kHz (half the CD-quality rate), most people would notice the drop in quality right away.\nSamples can be created by sampling live audio and video or by sampling previously recorded analog media.  Since samples estimate the analog signal, the digital representation is never as accurate as the analog data.  However, if a high enough sampling rate is used, the difference is not noticeable to the human senses.  Because digital information can be edited and saved using a computer and will not deteriorate like analog media, the quality\/convenience tradeoff involved in sampling is well worthwhile."

            "Sandboxing is a software management strategy that isolates applications from critical system resources and other programs.  It provides an extra layer of security that prevents malware or harmful applications from negatively affecting your system.\nWithout sandboxing, an application may have unrestricted access to all system resources and user data on a computer.  A sandboxed app on the other hand, can only access resources in its own \"sandbox.\"  An application's sandbox is a limited area of storage space and memory that contains the only resources the program requires.  If a program needs to access resources or files outside the sandbox, permission must be explicitly granted by the system.\nFor example, when a sandboxed app is installed in OS X, a specific directory is created for that application's sandbox.  The app is given unlimited read and write access to the sandboxed directory, but it is not allowed to read or write any other files on the computer's storage device unless it is authorized by the system.  This access is commonly granted using the Open or Save dialog box, both of which require direct user input.\nSandboxed App Limitations\nWhile sandboxing provides added security for users, it can also limit the capabilities of an application.  For example, a sandboxed app may not allow command line input since the commands are run at a system level.  Utilities such as backup programs and keyboard shortcut managers may not be granted sufficient permissions to function correctly.  For this reason, some programs cannot be sandboxed.\nNOTE: OS X has supported sandboxing since OS X Lion, which was released in 2011.  The Mac App Store has required apps to be sandboxed since March 2012.  Windows does not natively provide app sandboxing, but some apps (such as Microsoft Office programs) can be run in a sandboxed mode.  Additionally, several Windows utilities allow you to run apps in a sandbox, preventing them from affecting the system or other applications."

            "Stands for \"Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets.\"  Sass is an extension of cascading style sheets (CSS), the language used to define the layout and formatting of HTML documents.  It uses fully-compatible CSS syntax, but provides additional features like CSS variables and nested rules that make CSS more efficient and easier to edit.\nOne of the drawbacks of standard CSS is that it does not support variables.  For example, if you have multiple styles that are the same color, you need to define the color separately for each style.  If you decide to change the color, you must change it for every instance in the the CSS document.  With Sass, you can define the color as a variable and assign the variable to every style that uses it.  If you decide to change the color, you only need to change it once \u2014 where it is initially defined in the document.\nThe below example shows how to define and use a CSS variable in Sass.\n&nbsp; $myColor: #00695C;\n\n&nbsp; .pageTop { background-color: $myColor; }\n&nbsp; .infoText { color: $myColor; }\n&nbsp; .pageBottom { background-color: $myColor; }\nSass also supports nested rules, allowing developers to write more efficient code.  In the example below, the .button class is nested within the #top p style.\n&nbsp; #top p\n&nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; color: #004D40;\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; .button\n&nbsp; &nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; background-color: #039BE5;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; color: #FFF;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; }\n&nbsp; }\nWhen compiled, the above code will produce the following CSS:\n&nbsp; #top p { color: #004D40; }\n&nbsp; #top p .button { background-color: #039BE5; color: #FFF; }\nWhile Sass provides several benefits to web developers, Sass documents are not recognized by web browsers.  Therefore, a Sass file must first be compiled into CSS before being used in an HTML document.  This can be done locally before uploading the CSS to the web server using program like Compass.app or Koala.  It can also be compiled on the server using a PHP or Ruby script that compiles Sass into CSS."

The scalability of a single computer, such as a workstation, depends on how expandable the computer is.  In this context, the words \"scalable,\" \"expandable,\" and \"upgradable\" may be used interchangeably.  For example, a computer that has multiple drive bays has scalable disk space, since more internal storage devices may be added.  A computer that includes multiple PCI slots has scalable graphics and I\/O capabilities since PCI cards may be added or upgraded.  A scalable network should be able to support additional connections without data transfers slowing down.  In each instance, scalable hardware can expand to meet increasing demands.\nScalable software typically refers to business applications that can adapt to support an increasing amount of data or a growing number of users.  For example, a scalable database management system (DBMS) should be able to efficiently expand as more data is added to the database.  Scalable Web hosting software should make it easy to add new users and new Web hosting accounts.  They key is that the software \"grows\" along with the increased usage.  This means scalable programs take up limited space and resources for smaller uses, but can grow efficiently as more demands are placed on the software.\nThe scalability of hardware and software is important to growing businesses.  After all, it is typically more economical to upgrade current systems than replace them with new ones.  While all hardware and software have some limitations, scalable equipment and programs offer a long-term advantage over those that are not designed to grow over time."

This is ideal for photographs, magazines, and various documents.  Most flatbed scanners have a cover that lifts up so that books and other bulky objects can also be scanned.  Another type of scanner is a sheet-fed scanner, which can only accept paper documents.  While sheet-fed scanners cannot scan books, some models include an automatic document feeder, or ADF, which allows multiple pages to be scanned in sequence.\nScanners work in conjunction with computer software programs, which import data from the scanner.  Most scanners include basic scanning software that allows the user to configure, initiate, and import scans.  Scanning plug-ins can also be installed, which allow various software programs to import scanned images directly.  For example, if a scanner plug-in is installed for Adobe Photoshop, a user can create new images in Photoshop directly from the connected scanner.\nWhile Photoshop can edit scanned images, some programs like Acrobat and OmniPage can actually recognize scanned text.  This technology is called optical character recognition, or OCR.  Scanning software that includes OCR can turn a scanned text document into a digital text file that can be opened and edited by a word processor.

            "Screen burn or \"screen burn-in\" is a residual image left on a screen after displaying the same image for a long time.  It is a faded version of the image or \"ghost image\" that covers part or all of the screen.\nScreen burn is usually caused by video or graphics with content that does not move or change for an extended period of time.  Examples include the menu bar on a Mac or the task bar on a Windows computer.  On a TV, it may be the logo of a specific channel or the information panel of a video game.  On a smartphone, it may be the status bar at the top of the screen.  If certain pixels consistently display the same image while other pixels display changing graphics, the unchanging pixels may leave behind a ghost image.\nScreen burn affects several types of screens, including CRTs, plasma displays, and OLED screens.  In older displays, such as CRT monitors, leaving a single image displayed for a long time could physically damage the screen.  This type of burn-in could produce dark spots that were noticeable even when the display was turned off.  In modern displays, screen burn typically occurs when the electronics that produce light lose their luminance.  When specific pixels display a single image for a long time, they may lose their red, green, or blue (RGB) brightness relative to other pixels.  This may produce a ghost image that is the inverse of the image that was consistently displayed.\nScreen burn is rare with LCD panels because liquid crystals are less susceptible to burn-in.  OLED displays, on the other hand, are susceptible to screen burn since individual LEDs may lose their luminance relative to other LEDs if overused.  This may happen when certain pixels display the same color over a long period of time.\nHow to Avoid Screen Burn\nScreen burn is rare on modern displays with normal use.  For noticeable screen burn to take place, you would have to run the same program or tune to the same channel every day for several weeks or months.  However, if you consistently play the same video game or watch the same channel, screen burn can happen over time.  You can limit and possibly avoid screen burn by varying the content you watch on your screen.  You should also turn off your display when you're not using it.  Finally, it is wise to enable sleep mode or a screensaver that automatically runs when the screen has not changed for awhile."

If the page is too wide for the window, another scroll bar will appear at the bottom of the window, allowing you to scroll to the left and right.

As you may have noticed, the size of the slider may change for different windows.  This is because the slider's size represents what percentage of the window's content is currently being displayed within the window.

Instead, data accessed from secondary memory is first loaded into RAM and is then sent to the processor.  The RAM plays an important intermediate role, since it provides much faster data access speeds than secondary memory.  By loading software programs and files into primary memory, computers can process data much more quickly.\nWhile secondary memory is much slower than primary memory, it typically offers far greater storage capacity.  For example, a computer may have a one terabyte hard drive, but only 16 gigabytes of RAM.  That means the computer has roughly 64 times more secondary memory than primary memory.  Additionally, secondary memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains its data with or without electrical power.  RAM, on the other hand, is erased when a computer is shut down or restarted.  Therefore, secondary memory is used to store \"permanent data,\" such as the operating system, applications, and user files.\nNOTE: Secondary memory may also be called \"secondary storage.\"  However, this term is a bit more ambiguous, since internal storage devices are sometimes called \"primary storage devices\" as well."

Random Seed\nA random seed is a value used to generate random data.  Since computers are programmed to follow instructions based on specific input, creating random output is more difficult than it might seem.  In order to generate a random value, another value called a \"random seed\" must be provided as input.  This may be a timestamp (which can include milliseconds), a system value (such as a GUID), a hardware serial number, or another unique value.\nA random seed may be generated automatically (e.g., a timestamp) or may be explicitly passed to a randomizing function as a parameter.  The function uses the seed value to produce random output, which is typically a number.\n2. Seed Data\nSeed data is information that is loaded to enable a function or program to work correctly.  If a function queries an empty database, for example, it will not produce useful output.  If the database is \"seeded\" with data, the function will generate meaningful results.  Seed data is often used for testing purposes.  It may be created using an automated process or can be entered manually.\n3. P2P Seed\nA peer-to-peer (P2P) seed is a or computer (or \"peer\") that uploads one or more files on a file sharing network, such as BitTorrent.  Once a user downloads a complete file, he or she can share the file with other users.  Peers that provide files for other torrent users to download are called seeds.  Peers that download files but rarely or never upload them are called leeches."

It is a tool developers use to ensure functions only access valid data and run at the right time.  A semaphore can prevent a deadlock or race condition by disallowing access to a resource when it is not available.\nThere are two main types of semaphores in computer programming: binary and counting.\nBinary Semaphores\nA binary semaphore is a boolean variable that can have only two possible values (0 or 1).  It is often used as a lock to restrict access to a function or resource.  For example, semaphore A controls function getData().  If A = 0, getData() will not excute.  If A = 1, getData() will run.  A binary semaphore is also considered a flag or a switch that is either on or off.\nCounting Semaphores\nA counting semaphore can be any non-negative integer, also known as a whole number.  Its value may increase or decrease based on the results of one or more functions.  For example, a counting semaphore may keep track of the number of available resources in a resource pool.  If the semaphore decrements more than it increments, it will eventually reach 0.  A zero value indicates there are no more resources left.\nNOTE: A \"semaphore\" in the real world is a flag or other object used to signal from a distance.

            "A serial number is a unique number or string of characters that identifies a product.  While any product may have a serial number, they are especially common for electronics, such as computers, mobile devices, and audio and video equipment.\nBecause serial numbers are unique, they can be used to identify a specific device.  Therefore, when you register a product online, you will most likely be asked to enter the serial number of the product along with some other information.  The serial number or \"SN\" links the specific device to your name or account, which is helpful for warranty purposes and for technical support requests you may have while using the product.\nThere is no standard format for serial numbers.  Instead, the style or convention is chosen by each manufacturer.  Some serial numbers only include numbers, while others are alphanumeric, meaning they include both letters and numbers.  It is common for serial numbers to exclude the letter \"O\" to avoid confusion with the number \"0.\"\nSerial numbers also help manufacturers keep track of their products.  For example, if a company builds the same product at multiple facilities, each location may use a different range of serial numbers.  A manufacturer may also use different serial number ranges for different time periods.  This helps with quality control across multiple locations and times.  When a product is recalled for example, the manufacturer may provide a range of serial numbers for the affected devices.\nHow to Find a Serial Number\nSerial numbers are often printed on the back or bottom of electronic devices, making them inconspicuous but also notoriously difficult to locate.  The number may be printed on a label or may be engraved into the hardware itself.  It is important to look for the term \"Serial Number,\" \"Ser. No.,\" or \"SN\" since there may be other numbers listed, such as the product ID, network ID, or UPC.\nMany electronics save the serial number permanently in the device ROM.  This allows you to view it using software.  For example, you can look up the serial number of a computer by viewing the computer properties (in Windows) or \"About this computer\" (in macOS).  You can view the serial number of your smartphone by going to Settings &rarr; About.  In many cases, you can can view the SN of a peripheral device by connecting it to a computer or TV with a USB or HDMI cable.\nNOTE: In software, the term \"serial number\" may also be used synonymously with \"activation key.\"  However, this has become less common in recent years."

Each type runs software specific to the purpose of the server.  For example, a Web server may run Apache HTTP Server or Microsoft IIS, which both provide access to websites over the Internet.  A mail server may run a program like Exim or iMail, which provides SMTP services for sending and receiving email.  A file server might use Samba or the operating system's built-in file sharing services to share files over a network.\nWhile server software is specific to the type of server, the hardware is not as important.  In fact, a regular desktop computers can be turned into a server by adding the appropriate software.  For example, a computer connected to a home network can be designated as a file server, print server, or both.\nWhile any computer can be configured as a server, most large businesses use rack-mountable hardware designed specifically for server functionality.  These systems, often 1U in size, take up minimal space and often have useful features such as LED status lights and hot-swappable hard drive bays.  Multiple rack-mountable servers can be placed in a single rack and often share the same monitor and input devices.  Most servers are accessed remotely using remote access software, so input devices are often not even necessary.\nWhile servers can run on different types of computers, it is important that the hardware is sufficient to support the demands of the server.  For instance, a web server that runs lots of web scripts in real-time should have a fast processor and enough RAM to handle the \"load\" without slowing down.  A file server should have one or more fast hard drives or SSDs that can read and write data quickly.

Therefore, it would make sense to create the Sports variable as a set if it is likely to contain multiple values.  One example is a web form that asks a user to select sports that he or she likes to play.  Since the user can choose one or more of the predefined values, the resulting data should be stored as a set.  If the form were to ask the user to choose his or her favorite sport, the variable should be declared as an enum instead.\nLike enums, sets can be used to ensure data integrity by limiting the values a variable or database record can store.

Sierra was the first version of OS X that Apple officially labeled \"macOS\" instead of OS X.\nLike other incremental releases of Apple's desktop operating system, Sierra built on previous versions, incorporating the same user interface and adding several new features.  Notably, Sierra was designed to work more seamlessly with other Apple devices, such as iPhones and Apple Watches.  For example, Sierra was the first version of macOS to support Universal Clipboard, which allows you to copy something on your phone and paste it on your Mac, or vice versa.  It also supports automatic login using an Apple Watch.  Safari, the web browser included with macOS Sierra, supports Apple Pay using an iPhone or Apple Watch. \nSierra also increased iCloud integration by syncing the Desktop and Documents folders with iCloud drive.  This makes it easier to keep files consistent across multiple Macs.  It was also the first version of Apple's desktop OS to include Siri, Apple's voice assistant that was introduced in iOS.  Siri can be accessed by clicking the icon in the right side of the menu bar or by pressing and holding Command+Space Bar.  You can speak commands, such as \"Show my Downloads folder\" or \"Make the screen brighter,\" instead of performing the actions with your keyboard and mouse.\nNOTE: Before Mac OS X (introduced in 2001), Apple's desktop operating system was called \"Mac OS.\"  With the release of Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) in 2012, Apple changed the name from Mac OS X to just \"OS X.\"  The switch to \"macOS\" with Sierra marks a return to the \"Mac OS\" name, while using the same naming convention as Apple's other operating systems \u2013 iOS, watchOS, and tvOS."

Silent installs are performed by many legitimate software programs, but they are also used by malware and PUPs to hide the installation process from the user.\nA typical installer has several parameters that instruct the installer how to run.  Examples include where the program should be installed, if a shortcut should be placed on desktop, and if additional components should be installed.  In a non-silent or \"attended installation,\" the user is prompted to select or confirm these options during the installation process.  In a silent install, these items are selected automatically and the installer runs from start to finish without requiring any user input.\nSilent installs are useful for simple programs that have limited installation options.  They are also helpful for installing software on several machines at once.  For example, a network administrator may prefer to distribute a software program via a silent installer to ensure all users within the network have the same installation settings.  Even though silent installers run without any user interaction, legitimate programs typically require you to manually initiate the installation process.\nWhile silent installations are used for many good reasons, some programs, such as spyware and adware use silent installers to run without your knowledge.  These types of programs may even run without you initiating the installation process.  They may be tacked on to another installer or executed by a malicious file, such as virus."

A smart thermostat can be configured to keep the house warm during the day and cool at night.  If you leave your house for several days, you can set the thermostat to \"vacation mode,\" which will reduce the energy usage of your HVAC system.\nAdvanced smart homes may include several other \"smart\" components.  For example, smart blinds can shut to keep the house cool or open to allow more heat in through the windows.  Some blinds can be programmed to open slowly in the morning to help you wake up to natural lighting.  A smart security system can monitor suspicious activity and sound an alarm or contact the police if necessary.  It may also provide convenient features such as automatically unlocking the front door and turning on lights when you pull into the driveway.\nA smart home may also include \"smart appliances\" that you can monitor and control remotely.  For example, you can check if you remembered to run the dishwasher before you left the house and turn it on from your mobile app if you forgot.  If you have a smart oven, you can turn it on while you are on the road so that your food will be cooked when you get home.  A smart refrigerator can detect the items it contains and let you know when you need to get more milk when you're at the grocery store, for example.\nSeveral different manufacturers make smart components and appliances.

The email may appear to be legitimate, but if you click the link in the message, it may direct you to a fake website that captures your information.\nAnother common type of social engineering uses false alerts on websites.  For example, when you open a webpage, you might receive a message saying your computer has a virus and you need to download a specific program or call a phone number to fix it.  In most cases, these alerts are auto-generated and are completely false.  If you follow the instructions in the alert message, you may end up downloading spyware or giving away personal information over the phone.\nSocial engineering may also take place through social media.  For example, malicious users may post public messages on sites like Facebook and Twitter that lure people into sharing personal information.  Common example include false giveaways and prize alerts.  In some cases, social engineers will even build relationships with others using online chat or private messaging before convincing them to divulge confidential data.\nWhile most Internet users do not harbor malicious intent, social engineering is an unfortunate reality of the Internet.

Some sound cards also support digital audio input and output, either through a standard TRS (tip-ring-sleeve) connection or via an optical audio port, such as Toslink connector.\nWhile there are many types of sound cards, any type that produces an analog output must include a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).  This converts the outgoing signal from digital to analog, which can be played through most speaker systems.  Sounds cards that support analog input also require an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).  This digitizes the incoming analog signal, so the computer can process it.\nIn some computers, the sound card is part of the motherboard, while other machines may have an actual card that resides in a PCI slot.  If you want to add more audio capabilities to your computer, such as additional input or output channels, you can install a new sound card.  Professional sound cards often support higher sampling rates (such as 192 kHz instead of 44.1 kHz) and may have more inputs and outputs.  Some cards may also have 1\/4 in. connectors instead of 3.5 mm, which accommodates most instrument outputs.\nWhile professional sound cards can add more audio capabilities to your computer, another popular option for multi-channel recording is a breakout box.  This is an external box that typically includes a built-in sound card and multiple audio connections.  For example, a breakout box may support 16 channels of audio, which would be impossible to fit on a single card.

Programmers may also add comments to their source code that explain sections of the code.  These comments help other programmers gain at least some idea of what the source code does without requiring hours to decipher it.  Comments can be helpful to the original programmer as well if many months or years have gone by since the code was written.\nShort programs called scripts can be run directly from the source code using a scripting engine, such as a VBScript or PHP engine.  Most large programs, however, require that the source code first be compiled, which translates the code into a language the computer can understand.  When changes are made to the source code of these programs, they must be recomplied in order for the changes to take effect in the program.\nSmall programs may use only one source code file, while larger programs may reference hundreds or even thousands of files.  Having multiple source files helps organize the program into different sections.  Having one file that contains every variable and function can make it difficult to locate specific sections of the code.  Regardless of how many source code files are used to create a program, you will most likely not see any of the original files on your computer.

            "Speakers are one of the most common output devices used with computer systems.  Some speakers are designed to work specifically with computers, while others can be hooked up to any type of sound system.  Regardless of their design, the purpose of speakers is to produce audio output that can be heard by the listener.\nSpeakers are transducers that convert electromagnetic waves into sound waves.  The speakers receive audio input from a device such as a computer or an audio receiver.  This input may be either in analog or digital form.  Analog speakers simply amplify the analog electromagnetic waves into sound waves.  Since sound waves are produced in analog form, digital speakers must first convert the digital input to an analog signal, then generate the sound waves.\nThe sound produced by speakers is defined by frequency and amplitude.  The frequency determines how high or low the pitch of the sound is.  For example, a soprano singer's voice produces high frequency sound waves, while a bass guitar or kick drum generates sounds in the low frequency range.  A speaker system's ability to accurately reproduce sound frequencies is a good indicator of how clear the audio will be.  Many speakers include multiple speaker cones for different frequency ranges, which helps produce more accurate sounds for each range.  Two-way speakers typically have a tweeter and a mid-range speaker, while three-way speakers have a tweeter, mid-range speaker, and subwoofer.\nAmplitude, or loudness, is determined by the change in air pressure created by the speakers' sound waves.  Therefore, when you crank up your speakers, you are actually increasing the air pressure of the sound waves they produce.  Since the signal produced by some audio sources is not very high (like a computer's sound card), it may need to be amplified by the speakers.  Therefore, most external computer speakers are amplified, meaning they use electricity to amplify the signal.  Speakers that can amplify the sound input are often called active speakers.  You can usually tell if a speaker is active if it has a volume control or can be plugged into an electrical outlet.  Speakers that don't have any internal amplification are called passive speakers.  Since these speakers don't amplify the audio signal, they require a high level of audio input, which may be produced by an audio amplifier.\nSpeakers typically come in pairs, which allows them to produce stereo sound.  This means the left and right speakers transmit audio on two completely separate channels.  By using two speakers, music sounds much more natural since our ears are used to hearing sounds from the left and right at the same time.  Surround systems may include four to seven speakers (plus a subwoofer), which creates an even more realistic experience."

A microphone records a person's voice and the hardware converts the signal from analog sound waves to digital audio.  The audio data is then processed by software, which interprets the sound as individual words.\nA common type of speech recognition is \"speech-to-text\" or \"dictation\" software, such as Dragon Naturally Speaking, which outputs text as you speak.  While you can buy speech recognition programs, modern versions of the Macintosh and Windows operating systems include a built-in dictation feature.  This capability allows you to record text as well as perform basic system commands.\nIn Windows, some programs support speech recognition automatically while others do not.  You can enable speech recognition for all applications by selecting All Programs &rarr; Accessories &rarr; Ease of Access &rarr; Windows Speech Recognition and clicking \"Enable dictation everywhere.\"  In OS X, you can enable dictation in the \"Dictation & Speech\" system preference pane.  Simply check the \"On\" button next to Dictation to turn on the speech-to-text capability.  To start dictating in a supported program, select Edit &rarr; Start Dictation.  You can also view and edit spoken commands in OS X by opening the \"Accessibility\" system preference pane and selecting \"Speakable Items.\"\nAnother type of speech recognition is interactive speech, which is common on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.  Both iOS and Android devices allow you to speak to your phone and receive a verbal response.  The iOS version is called \"Siri,\" and serves as a personal assistant.  You can ask Siri to save a reminder on your phone, tell you the weather forecast, give you directions, or answer many other questions.  This type of speech recognition is considered a natural user interface (or NUI), since it responds naturally to your spoken input.\nWhile many speech recognition systems only support English, some speech recognition software supports multiple languages.

They worked by checking each word in a text document against a list of words in the program's \"dictionary.\"  If no match was found, the spellchecker would stop and display an alert saying the word was misspelled.\nModern spellcheckers work in a similar way, but include several advancements.  For example, most spellcheckers now allow you to customize the dictionary by adding words so they won't be flagged as misspellings in the future.  Microsoft Word's spellchecker checks grammar as well as spelling.  For instance, it may tell you to use a singular pronoun rather than a plural one or suggest that you use \"which\" instead of \"that\" after a comma in a sentence.\nMost spellcheckers now perform spellchecks in real-time, underlining misspelled words (typically in red) as you type.  OS X will often correct common spelling mistakes automatically (for example, changing \"teh\" to \"the\"). You can also right-click a misspelled word in OS X and select the correct spelling from a list of options.  If the word is spelled correctly, you can choose \"Learn Spelling\" to add the word to the OS X dictionary.\nMobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets take spellchecking to a whole new level with autocorrect and autocomplete.  For example, iOS and Android automatically correct misspellings by guessing what letters you meant to press on the keyboard.  Microsoft Windows Phone provides spelling suggestions as you type, which allows you to complete words by simply selecting them from a list.\nNOTE: Spellcheck may be used as both a noun (performing a spellcheck) and a verb (spellchecking a document).  Ironically, there is no official spelling of the term, as \"spell-check\" and \"spell check\" are also acceptable.  However, \"spellcheck\" is most common."

All the major search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!, use spiders to build and update their indexes.  These programs constantly browse the Web, traveling from one hyperlink to another.\nFor example, when a spider visits a website's home page, there may be 30 links on the page.  The spider will follow each of the links, adding all the pages it finds to the search engine's index.  Of course, the new pages that the spider finds may also have links, which the spider continues to follow.  Some of these links may point to pages within the same website (internal links), while others may lead to different sites (external links).  The external links will cause the spider to jump to new sites, indexing even more pages.\nBecause of the interwoven nature of website links, spiders often return to websites that have already been indexed.  This allows search engines to keep track of how many external pages link to each page.  Usually, the more incoming links a page has, the higher it will be ranked in search engine results.  Spiders not only find new pages and keep track of links, they also track changes to each page, helping search engine indexes stay up to date.\nSpiders are also called robots and crawlers, which may be preferable for those who are not fond of arachnids.

This is typically done by hiding one's identity or faking the identity of another user on the Internet.\nSpoofing can take place on the Internet in several different ways.  One common method is through e-mail.  E-mail spoofing involves sending messages from a bogus e-mail address or faking the e-mail address of another user.  Fortunately, most e-mail servers have security features that prevent unauthorized users from sending messages.  However, spammers often send spam messages from their own SMTP, which allows them to use fake e-mail addresses.  Therefore, it is possible to receive e-mail from an address that is not the actual address of the person sending the message.\nAnother way spoofing takes place on the Internet is via IP spoofing.  This involves masking the IP address of a certain computer system.  By hiding or faking a computer's IP address, it is difficult for other systems to determine where the computer is transmitting data from.  Because IP spoofing makes it difficult to track the source of a transmission, it is often used in denial-of-service attacks that overload a server.  This may cause the server to either crash or become unresponsive to legitimate requests.  Fortunately, software security systems have been developed that can identify denial-of-service attacks and block their transmissions.\nFinally, spoofing can be done by simply faking an identity, such as an online username.  For example, when posting on an Web discussion board, a user may pretend he is the representative for a certain company, when he actually has no association with the organization.  In online chat rooms, users may fake their age, gender, and location.\nWhile the Internet is a great place to communicate with others, it can also be an easy place to fake an identity.  Therefore, always make sure you know who you are communicating with before giving out private information."

For example, when you print a document from within an application, the document data is spooled to a temporary storage area while the printer warms up.  As soon as the printer is ready to print the document, the data is sent from the spool to the printer and the document is printed.\nPrint spooling gets its name from technology used in the 1960s when print jobs were stored on large reels of magnetic tape.

Each cell can each store a unique instance of data.  By entering data into a spreadsheet, information can be stored in a more structured way than using plain text  The row\/column structure also allows the data to be analyzed using formulas and calculations.\nFor example, each row of a spreadsheet may store information about a person who has an account with a certain company.  Each column may store a different aspect of the person's information, such as the first name, last name, address, phone number, favorite food, etc.  The spreadsheet program can analyze this data by counting the number of people who live in a certain zip code, listing all the people who's favorite food is fried veal, or performing other calcuations.  In this way, a spreadsheet is similar to a database.\nHowever, spreadsheets are more streamlined than databases and are especially useful for processing numbers.  This is why spreadsheets are commonly used in scientific and financial applications.  For example, a spreadsheet may store bank account data, including balance and interest information.  A column that stores the account balances of several clients can easily be summed to produce the total value of all the clients' balances.  These amounts can be multiplied by the interest rate from another cell to see what the value of the accounts will be in a year.  Once the formula has been created, modifying the value of just the interest rate cell will also change the projected value of all the accounts.\nThe most commonly used spreadsheet application is Microsoft Excel, but several other spreadsheet programs are available including IBM Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows and AppleWorks and Numbers for Mac OS X."

Graphic artists created small 2D images that were used to represent characters and other objects.  Developers referenced these sprites in the source code and assigned properties such as when the sprites were displayed and how they interacted with other sprites.  For example, in a side-scroller, such as Super Mario Bros, the sprite of an enemy Koopa would turn into a flattened Koopa when Super Mario jumped on it.  Today, some video games still use 2D sprites, but most mainstream games use 3D polygons instead.  Since computers and gaming consoles now have dedicated 3D video cards, they can actually render 3D objects more efficiently than 2D sprites.\nWhile sprites have become less common in modern video games, they are still used by software developers for other purposes.  For example, sprites are often used to add buttons, symbols, and other user interface elements to software programs.  Developers can attach actions to sprites within the user interface, such as playing an animation or changing the current view of the window when the sprite is clicked.  Sprites are especially useful for adding custom graphics that are not natively supported by the operating system's API.\nSprites are also used on the Web for navigation buttons and for adding visual appeal to webpages.  In recent years, sprite sheets have become a popular way for web developers to load website graphics.  By combining a large number of sprites into a single image, all the sprites can be downloaded and cached by a user's browser with a single request to the server.

When an item is removed, it can either be removed from the top or bottom of the stack.  A stack in which items are removed the top is considered a \"LIFO\" (Last In, First Out) stack.

Therefore, the computer uses very little power in standby mode.\nSince standby mode saves energy, it is a good idea to put your computer to sleep if you are going to be away from it for more than 15 or 20 minutes.  You can also use the Power Options control panel (in Windows) or the Energy Saver System Preference (in Mac OS X) to automatically put your computer to sleep after it has been inactive for a specific amount of time.  Then, when you take a break from your computer, your computer can take a break as well."

Each section of the subnet mask can contain a number from 0 to 255, just like an IP address.  For example, a typical subnet mask for a Class C IP address is:\n255.255.255.0\nIn the example above, the first three sections are full (255 out of 255), meaning the IP addresses of devices within the subnet mask must be identical in the first three sections.

For example, a home office may have a computer, monitor, printer, cable modem, and powered speakers all plugged into one surge protector, which is plugged into a single outlet in the wall.  The surge protector allows many devices to use one outlet, while protecting each of them from electrical surges.\nSurge protectors, sometimes called power strips, prevent surges in electrical current by sending the excess current to the grounding wire (which is the round part of the plug below the two flat metal pieces on U.S. outlet plugs).  If the surge is extra high, such as from a lightning strike, a fuse in the surge protector will blow and the current will prevented from reaching any of the devices plugged into the surge protector.  This means the noble surge protector will have given its life for the rest of the equipment, since the fuse is destroyed in the process.\nWhile surge protectors all perform the same basic function, they come in many shapes and sizes with different levels of protection.  Some may look like basic power strips, while others may be rack mounted or fit directly against the wall.  Most surge protectors offer six to ten different outlets.  Cheaper surge protectors offer limited protection for surges (under 1000 joules), while more expensive ones offer protection for several thousand joules and include a monetary guarantee on connected devices if a power surge happens.  Typically, you get what you pay for, so if you have an expensive computer system, it is wise to buy a quality surge protector that offers at least 1000 joules of protection.\nSome surge protectors also include line conditioning, which uses an electromagnet to maintain a consistent level of electricity when there are slight variations in current.  For example, you might notice your computer monitor or television fade for a moment when you turn on a high-powered device, like a vacuum or air conditioner.  A surge protector with line conditioning should prevent connected devices from being affected by these slight variances in current.\nWhile you may be able to hook up your computer system without a surge protector, it is important to protect your equipment by using one.  You may not need a large, expensive surge protector with line conditioning, but using a quality surge protector for all your electronic devices is a smart choice."

It allows several common commands to be combined and does require semicolons (;) at the end of each statement.\nAdditionally, Swift handles several programming obstacles automatically.  For example, Swift:\n\ninitializes variables before they are used\nhandles \"nil\" (NULL) values explicitly\nensures array indices are in bounds\nprevents integers from overflowing their allotted memory\nmanages memory automatically\n\nApple's Xcode software development IDE has supported Swift since version 6 (released in 2014).  Xcode also supports \"Swift Playgrounds,\" a feature that allows programmers to edit Swift code and see the results immediately.  For example, the playground may display the source code on the left and an app simulator on the right.  Changes to the code update the app simulation on-the-fly.  Several playgrounds are included with Xcode to provide an easy way to learn the language.\nSince Apple develops and maintains the Swift language, it is optimized for Apple hardware.  Therefore an iOS app developed in Swift may perform better than a similar app developed in another language.  Apple also updates Swift with new features on a regular basis.  This allows developers programming in Swift to take advantage of the latest advances in Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other Apple products.\nFile extension: .SWIFT"

For example, swiping the screen from right to left in a photo viewing application typically displays the next photo.  While browsing multiple photos, swiping up or down may allow you to scroll through the photo library.  Most smartphones also allow you to swipe left or right to switch between home screens.\nDevices that support multi-touch may allow you to swipe with multiple fingers to perform different functions.

These ports can connect to computers, cable or DSL modems, and other switches.  High-end switches can have more than 50 ports and often are rack mounted.\nSwitches are more advanced than hubs and less capable than routers.  Unlike hubs, switches can limit the traffic to and from each port so that each device connected to the switch has a sufficient amount of bandwidth.  For this reason, you can think of a switch as a \"smart hub.\"  However, switches don't provide the firewall and logging capabilities that routers do.  Routers can often be configured by software (typically via a Web interface), while switches only work the way the hardware was designed.\nThe term \"switch\" can also be used to refer to a small lever or button on computer hardware.

It is similar to a Windows \"shortcut\" or Mac \"alias,\" but is not an actual file.  Instead, a symbolic link is a entry in a file system that points to a directory or file.  The system recognizes the symbolic link as the actual directory or file, providing a alternate way to access it.\nSymbolic links are supported by Mac, Windows, and Unix, but are most commonly found on Unix systems, since Unix is known for having a large (and often confusing) hierarchy of directories.  The root folder alone has several different subdirectories, many of which do not have a clearly defined purpose.  Examples include bin, dev, etc, lib, tmp, usr, and var.  This can make it difficult to find certain files, especially if they are located several directories deep in the file system.  Symbolic links help alleviate this problem by creating an easier way to access common files and folders.\nTo create a symlink in Unix, you can type a simple command at the command prompt using the syntax below.  (The \"-s\" part of the command is important, since it tells the system to create a symbolic link.)\nln -s [target directory or file] \/[shortcut]\nFor example, you can create a symlink \"\/apachelogs\" that points to \"\/usr\/local\/apache\/logs\" using the following command:\nln -s \/usr\/local\/apache\/logs \/apachelogs\nAfter entering the command above, you would be able to access the Apache logs directory by simply opening \"\/apachelogs.\"  While symlinks are recognized by most programs, it may be necessary to enable a program or process to follow symbolic links.  For example, in order for an Apache web server to recognize symbolic links, the line \"Options +FollowSymLinks\" must be added to the httpd.conf file."

This is also referred to as \"merging\" the data.  For example, if you have added a phone number to your phone since the last time you synced it with your computer, that number will be added to your computer's address book.  Similarly, any numbers entered into the computer's address book since the last sync will be added to the phone.  Most syncing programs also remove entries that have been deleted on either the device or the computer since the last sync.\nSince many devices can be synced with a single computer, the computer is often referred to as the \"hub\" for syncing portable electronics.  For example, you might be able to sync an iPod, Blackberry, and PDA using the same address book on your computer.

For example, C and Java use a similar syntax, while Perl has many characteristics that are not seen in either the C or Java languages.\nA program's source code must have correct syntax in order to compile correctly and be made into a program.  In fact, it must have perfect syntax, or the program will fail to compile and produce a \"syntax error.\"  A syntax error can be as simple as a missing parenthesis or a forgotten semicolon at the end of a statement.  Even these small errors will keep the source code from compiling.\nFortunately, most integrated development environments (IDEs) include a parser, which detects syntax errors within the source code.  Modern parsers can even highlight syntax errors before a program is compiled, making it easy for the programmer to locate and fix them.\nNOTE: Syntax errors are also called compile-time errors, since they can prevent a program from compiliing.

It allows an application to access functions and commands from the operating system's API.\nSystem calls perform system-level operations, such as communicating with hardware devices and reading and writing files.  By making system calls, developers can use pre-written functions supported by the operating system (OS) instead of writing them from scratch.  This simplifies development, improves app stability, and makes apps more \"portable\" between different versions of an OS.\nHow System Calls Work\nApplications run within an area of memory called user space.  A system call accesses the operating system kernel, which runs in kernel space.  When an application makes a system call, it must first request permission from the kernel.  This may be done with an interrupt request, which pauses the current process and transfers control to the kernel.\nIf the request is allowed, the kernel processes the request, such as creating or deleting a file.  When the operation is complete, the kernel passes the output back to the application, which transfers data from the kernel space to the user space in memory.  The application receives the output from the kernel as input.  In the source code of a program, this may be a parameter value or a return value within a function.  Once the input is received, the application resumes the process.\nA basic system call, such as getting the system date and time, may take a few nanoseconds.  A more advanced system call, such as establishing communication with a network device may require a few seconds.  In order to prevent bottlenecks, most operating systems initiate a separate kernel thread for each system call.  Modern operating systems are multithreaded, meaning they can process multiple system calls at one time."

Yet, even with these security measures in place, computers are often still vulnerable to outside access.  System hardening, also called Operating System hardening, helps minimize these security vulnerabilities.\nThe purpose of system hardening is to eliminate as many security risks as possible.  This is typically done by removing all non-essential software programs and utilities from the computer.  While these programs may offer useful features to the user, if they provide \"back-door\" access to the system, they must be removed during system hardening.\nAdvanced system hardening may involve reformatting the hard disk and only installing the bare necessities that the computer needs to function.  The CD drive is listed as the first boot device, which enables the computer to start from a CD or DVD if needed.  File and print sharing are turned off if not absolutely necessary and TCP\/IP is often the only protocol installed.  The guest account is disabled, the administrator account is renamed, and secure passwords are created for all user logins.  Auditing is enabled to monitor unauthorized access attempts.\nWhile these steps are often part of operating system hardening, system administrators may choose to perform other tasks that boost system security.  While both Macintosh and Windows operating systems can be hardened, system hardening is more often done on Windows machines, since they are more likely to have their security compromised."

It is the most widely used color space and is supported by most operating systems, software programs, monitors, and printers.\nEvery color on a computer screen is comprised of individual red, green, and blue values.  The sRGB specification make sure colors are represented the same way across different software programs and devices.  For example, if you select the sRGB color space in your image editor and for your printer (which is typically the default setting), the colors produced by the printer will closely match those on the screen.  If your color spaces do not match, the printed colors may appear noticeably different than the ones you see in your software program.\nIf you select the \"Adobe RGB\" color space in Photoshop, then print to an printer that is set to sRGB, the printed colors may appear dull compared to those on the screen.  This is because the Adobe RGB color space has a wider range of colors than sRGB.  Similarly, an image saved with an Adobe RGB color profile may appear to have less color when viewed on the web, since web browsers use sRGB as the default color space.\nMonitors and printers have unique tonal qualities, so colors may not appear exactly same on different devices or from screen to print, even when the sRGB color profile is used.  Therefore, high-end devices, such as those used in desktop publishing, allow for manual calibration to adjust for slight differences in color.  Even without calibration, sRGB provides a level of consistency for displaying colors, which is especially important across different platforms.\nHistory\nThe sRGB color space was created by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1996.  It was designed to provide a universal color space for devices and software programs without the need for embedded ICC (International Color Consortium) profiles.  The IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standardized the sRGB specification in 1999 as \"IEC 61966-2-1:1999.\"  Several decades later, sRGB is still the standard color space for 8-bit color.  However, modern displays, which can produce 10-bit or 12-bit color, may also support HDR, which provides a much wider range of colors than sRGB."
