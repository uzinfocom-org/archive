It is an improved version of ADSL (asymmetric DSL) that offers download speeds of up to 52 Mbps (6.5 megabytes per second) and upload speeds up to 16 Mbps (2 megabytes per second).\nLike previous DSL standards, VDSL operates over copper wires and can be deployed over existing telephone wiring.  This means an ISP can provide VDSL Internet access to users as long as they have a landline and are located within a specific proximity required by the ISP.  The connection is established through a VDSL modem, which connects to a computer or router on one end a telephone outlet on the other.\nVDSL was developed to support the high bandwidth requirements of HDTV, media streaming, and VoIP connections.  By providing downstream transmission rates of over 50 Mbps, VDSL has enough bandwidth to support all of these connections simultaneously.  This fast data transfer rate also allows VDSL to compete with cable Internet providers, which have historically offered faster Internet access speeds.\nThe first version of VDSL (ITU standard G.993.1) was approved in 2004 and is still commonly offered by Internet service providers.  However, an updated version called VDSL2 (ITU standard G.993.2) was introduced in 2006 and offers symmetric download and upload speeds of 100 Mbps.  VDSL2 is typically provided to businesses and other organizations that require high-speed connections for multiple systems."

When a device connects to the network, the router assigns it a unique local IP address, typically via DHCP.  Examples of local IP addresses include 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3, etc, with the router IP address set to 192.168.0.1.  Some routers use the IP address 10.0.1.1 and assign IP addresses 10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3, etc.  Local IPs are merged into a single public (or \"virtual\") IP using network address translation (NAT).  The virtual IP address is what identifies the devices on the Internet.\nA VIP often has a one-to-many relationship with devices on a network.  Therefore, multiple devices connected to the same router may have the same IP address on the Internet.\nVIPs are also used by servers.  For example, multiple web servers may share the same IP address, allowing them to distribute requests across multiple machines.

It enables groups of devices from multiple networks (both wired and wireless) to be combined into a single logical network.  The result is a virtual LAN that can be administered like a physical local area network.\nIn order to create a virtual LAN, the network equipment, such as routers and switches must support VLAN configuration.  The hardware is typically configured using a software admin tool that allows the network administrator to customize the virtual network.  The admin software can be used to assign individual ports or groups of ports on a switch to a specific VLAN.  For example, ports 1-12 on switch #1 and ports 13-24 on switch #2 could be assigned to the same VLAN.\nSay a company has three divisions within a single building \u2014 finance, marketing, and development.  Even if these groups are spread across several locations, VLANs can be configured for each one.  For instance, each member of the finance team could be assigned to the \"finance\" network, which would not be accessible by the marketing or development teams.  This type of configuration limits unnecessary access to confidential information and provides added security within a local area network.\nVLAN Protocols\nSince traffic from multiple VLANs may travel over the same physical network, the data must be mapped to a specific network.  This is done using a VLAN protocol, such as IEEE 802.1Q, Cisco's ISL, or 3Com's VLT.  Most modern VLANs use the IEEE 802.1Q protocol, which inserts an additional header or \"tag\" into each Ethernet frame.  This tag identifies the VLAN to which the sending device belongs, preventing data from being routed to systems outside the virtual network.  Data is sent between switches using a physical link called a \"trunk\" that connects the switches together.  Trunking must be enabled in order for one switch to pass VLAN information to another.\n4,904 VLANs can be created within an Ethernet network using the 802.1Q protocol, but in most network configurations only a few VLANs are needed.  Wireless devices can be included in a VLAN, but they must be routed through a wireless router that is connected to the LAN."

This is the memory used to store image data that the computer displays; it acts as a buffer between the CPU and the video card.  When a picture is to be displayed on the screen, the image is first read by the processor and then written to the VRAM.  The data is then converted by a RAM digital-to-analog converter (RAMDAC) into analog signals that are sent to the display.  Of course, the whole process happens so quickly, you don't notice it.  Unlike most system RAM, VRAM chips are dual-ported, which means that while the display is reading from VRAM to refresh the currently displayed image, the processor is writing a new image to the VRAM.  This prevents the display from flickering between the redrawing of images.\nThere are many different types of VRAM.  One popular kind is called Synchronous Graphics RAM (SGRAM).  It is an inexpensive type of RAM that is clock-synchronized.  This means data can be modified in a single operation rather than as a sequence of read, write, and update operations.  This allows background, foreground, and image fills to be handled more efficiently.  Another type of VRAM is Rambus Dynamic RAM (RDRAM).  It is designed by Rambus and includes a proprietary Rambus bus that speeds up the transfer of data through it.  Video editing pros like this chip since it is optimized for video streaming.  A third type of VRAM is Window RAM (WRAM).  This high-performance VRAM is dual-ported, has about 25% more bandwidth than standard VRAM, and typically costs less.  Finally, there is Multibank Dynamic RAM (MDRAM).  This is also high-performance VRAM, developed by MoSys, which divides the memory into divisions of 32 KB that can be accessed individually.  This makes memory transfers more efficient and increases overall performance.  Another advantage of MDRAM is that it can be manufactured with just the right amount of memory for a given resolution, so it is cheaper to manufacture than most other types of VRAM."

Since technology is a competitive field, one business can sometimes gain an advantage over another by announcing their product will be available first.  However, unforeseen delays can push back the release date significantly, leading both bloggers and news publishers alike to dub the product as \"vaporware.\"\nThere is no official length of delay that makes a product vaporware, but the term often surfaces after a delay of three months or more.

However, if a team of developers is working on a project, it is important that no two people are editing the same file at the same time.  When this happens, it is possible for one person to accidentally overwrite the changes made by someone else.  For this reason, version control allows users to \"check out\" files for editing.  When a file has been checked out from a shared file server, it cannot be edited by other users.  When the person finishes editing the file, he can save the changes and \"check in\" the file so that other users can edit the file.\nVersion control also allows users to track changes to files.  This type of version control is often used in software development and is also known as \"source control\" or \"revision control.\"  Popular version control systems like Subversion and CVS allow developers to save incremental versions of programs and source code files during the development process.  This provides the capability to rollback to an earlier version of the program if necessary.  For example, if bugs are found in a new version of a software program, the developer can review the previous version when debugging the code.\nVersion control software requires that all files are saved in a central location.  This location is called the repository and contains all previous and current versions of files managed by the VCS.

If his friends also like the video, they might tell their friends, who may tell other friends, etc.\nFor a video to become viral, it needs to reach a certain threshold that might be considered a \"tipping point.\"  Once it reaches this level of popularity, the number of views or \"hits\" spikes upwards and the video becomes viral.  This may happen when the video reaches YouTube's \"Most Popular\" list or is picked up and shown by a national news network.  Once this happens, the already popular video gets even more publicity and goes viral."

            "A virtual machine (or \"VM\") is an emulated computer system created using software.  It uses physical system resources, such as the CPU, RAM, and disk storage, but is isolated from other software on the computer.  It can easily be created, modified, or destroyed without affecting the host computer.\nVirtual machines provide similar functionality to physical machines, but they do not run directly on the hardware.  Instead, a software layer exists between the hardware and the virtual machine.  The software that manages one or more VMs is called a \"hypervisor\" and the VMs are called \"guests\" or virtualized instances.  Each guest can interact with the hardware, but the hypervisor controls them.  The hypervisor can start up and shut down virtual machines and also allocate a specific amount of system resources to each one.\nYou can create a virtual machine using virtualization software.  Examples include Microsoft Hyper-V Manager, VMware Workstation Pro, and Parallels Desktop.  These applications allow you to run multiple VMs on a single computer.  For example, Parallels Desktop for Mac allows you to run Windows, Linux, and macOS virtual machines on your Mac.\nVMs are ideal for testing software since developers can install one or more applications and revert to a saved state (or \"snapshot\") whenever needed.  Testing software on a regular operating system can cause unexpected crashes and may leave some files lingering behind after the software is uninstalled.  It is safer to test software on a virtual machine that is isolated from the operating system and can be fully reset as needed.\nCloud-Based Virtual Machines\nAs cloud services have grown in popularity, cloud-based VMs have become increasingly popular as well.  \"Cloud instances,\" as they are often called, run on a computer that is accessed over the Internet.  The VM is often controlled through a web browser or a remote access utility.  Cloud-based VMs are a common way for companies to test software deployments since they can test on dozens of machines without hosting the VMs locally."

            "All computers have physical memory, or RAM, which loads the operating system and active programs.  In some cases, RAM is soldered to the motherboard, while in others, it is installed using removable memory modules.  Either way, the system memory is limited to the total RAM installed.  Modern PCs typically have between 4 GB and 32 GB of RAM.\nWhen you open an application, your computer loads the app and related files into RAM.  If you open enough programs at one time, your computer will eventually run out of memory.  Instead of producing an \"out of memory\" error or forcing programs to quit, your computer can \"swap\" physical memory into virtual memory.\n\nVirtual memory is space on a storage device, such as an SSD or HDD, that serves as temporary system memory, similar to RAM.  This \"secondary memory\" can expand a computer's memory beyond the physical memory limit.  However, since storage devices are much slower than the RAM, data stored in virtual memory is often swapped back to RAM when accessed.\nSwapping data between the primary memory takes time.  Therefore, the more your computer uses virtual memory, the more it will slow down.  One of the best ways to improve your computer's performance is to install additional RAM.  With more free memory, your computer won't need to use virtual memory as often, resulting in fewer slowdowns and faster overall speed."

            "While the word \"virtual\" is typically overused in the computer world, it is aptly placed in the phrase \"virtual reality.\"  According to the American Heritage Dictionary, virtual means \"existing or resulting in essence or effect though not in actual fact, form, or name.\"   It can also mean \"created, simulated, or carried on by means of a computer or computer network.\"  Therefore, virtual reality is best described as an illusion of reality created by a computer system.\nA person may enter a world of virtual reality by putting on special glasses and headphones attached to a computer system running the virtual reality program.  These devices immerse the user with the sights and sounds of the virtual world.  Some virtual reality systems allow the user to also wear gloves with electronic sensors that can be used to touch or move virtual objects.  As the user moves his head or hands, the computer moves the virtual world accordingly in real-time.\nVirtual reality has been widely used for entertainment purposes, but the technology has found its way into the military and medical fields as well.  While virtual reality systems have advanced significantly over the past decade, for the most part they are still more \"virtual\" than reality."

        "definition": [
            "Virtualization can refer to a variety of computing concepts, but it usually refers to running multiple operating systems on a single machine.  While most computers only have one operating system installed, virtualization software allows a computer to run several operating systems at the same time.\nFor example, a Windows computer with VMware Workstation installed can run Linux within the Windows interface.  Similarly, a Macintosh computer can use Parallels Desktop to run Windows within the Mac OS X interface.  When another operating system (OS) is running on top of the main system, it is called a \"virtual machine.\"  This is because it acts like a typical computer but is actually running on top of another operating system.\nVirtualization software acts as a layer between a computer's primary OS and the virtual OS.  It allows the virtual system to access the computer's hardware, such as the RAM, CPU, and video card, just like the primary OS.  This is different than emulation, which actually translates each command into a form that the system's processor can understand.  Since Macintosh and Windows computers now both use the \"x86\" processor architecture, it is possible to run both OSes on the same machine via virtualization, rather than emulation.\nAnother type of virtualization involves connecting to a remote computer system and controlling it from your computer.  This is commonly referred to as remote access."

            "Like a biological virus, a computer virus is something you don't want to get.  Computer viruses are small programs or scripts that can negatively affect the health of your computer.  These malicious little programs can create files, move files, erase files, consume your computer's memory, and cause your computer not to function correctly.  Some viruses can duplicate themselves, attach themselves to programs, and travel across networks.  In fact opening an infected e-mail attachment is the most common way to get a virus.\nWe all know it's hard enough to get a computer to work well when it is healthy, let alone when it has been attacked by a virus.  Therefore, it is better to prevent an attack than to try and cure it.  There are many antivirus programs available that scan incoming files for viruses before they can cause damage to your computer.  Some of these programs include Norton AntiVirus, McAfee VirusScan, and Virex.  It is a good idea to have one of these programs on your computer to prevent a virus attack.  It is also important to update your virus definitions file at least once a month so that your anti-virus program can check for all the latest viruses.  It's a lot like having a glass of orange juice every morning \u2014 it keeps your computer's immune system strong and healthy."

            "A virus definition is binary pattern (a string of ones and zeros) that identifies a specific virus.  By checking a program or file against a list of virus definitions, antivirus software can determine if the program or file contains a virus.\nMost antivirus and Internet security programs reference a database of virus definitions when scanning files for viruses.  This is an effective way to detect known viruses.  However, when new viruses are created, antivirus software may not recognize them.  Therefore, most antivirus programs automatically update the virus definitions from an online database on a regular basis (such as once a week).\nSome antivirus programs use known virus definitions to generate heuristics that can detect unknown viruses.  These viruses may not match a virus definition exactly, but they may be similar enough that the antivirus software can mark the file as a possible virus.  While this offers extra protection against unknown viruses, it can also produce \"false positives,\" labeling files as potentially harmful when they do not contain viruses.\nThe accuracy of antivirus heuristics is improved over time based on the feedback end users and developers provide to antivirus software companies.  This feedback is used to whitelist or blacklist certain files.  By combining this information with up-to-date virus definitions, antivirus software can produce less false positives, yet still catch actual viruses."

It is an extension of the BASIC programming language that combines BASIC functions and commands with visual controls.  Visual Basic provides a graphical user interface GUI that allows the developer to drag and drop objects into the program as well as manually write program code.\nVisual Basic, also referred to as \"VB,\" is designed to make software development easy and efficient, while still being powerful enough to create advanced programs.  For example, the Visual Basic language is designed to be \"human readable,\" which means the source code can be understood without requiring lots of comments.  The Visual Basic program also includes features like \"IntelliSense\" and \"Code Snippets,\" which automatically generate code for visual objects added by the programmer.  Another feature, called \"AutoCorrect,\" can debug the code while the program is running.\nPrograms created with Visual Basic can be designed to run on Windows, on the Web, within Office applications, or on mobile devices.  Visual Studio, the most comprehensive VB development environment, or IDE, can be used to create programs for all these mediums.  Visual Studio .NET provides development tools to create programs based on the .NET framework, such as ASP.NET applications, which are often deployed on the Web.

While a simple cell phone video camera can get the job done, a standalone HD video camera will produce much higher quality videos.  You can publish videos as often as you like, though if you decide to maintain a blog, it helps to post them at consistent intervals, such as once a day or once a week.

The data is sent digitally, using the Internet Protocol (IP) instead of analog telephone lines.  This allows people to talk to one another long-distance and around the world without having to pay long distance or international phone charges.\nIn order to use VoIP, you need a computer, an Internet connection, and VoIP software.  You also need either a microphone, analog telephone adapter, or VoIP telephone.  Many VoIP programs allow you to use a basic microphone and speaker setup.  Others requires VoIP phones, which are like regular telephone handsets, but typically connect to your computer via USB.  Analog telephone adapters allow you to use regular phones with your computer.  IP phones are another option that connect directly to a router via Ethernet or wirelessly.  These phones have all the necessary software for VoIP built in and therefore do not require a computer.\nThe largest provider of VoIP services is Vonage, but there are several other companies that offer similar services.  While Vonage charges a monthly service fee, programs like Skype and PeerMe allow users to connect to each other and talk for free.  However, these free services may offer fewer connections, lower audio quality, and may be less reliable than paid services like Vonage.\nVoIP is also referred to as IP telephony, Internet telephony, and digital phone."

            "Volatile memory is memory that requires electric current to retain data.  When the power is turned off, all data is erased.  Volatile memory is often contrasted with non-volatile memory, which does not require power to maintain the data storage state.\nThe most common type of volatile memory is random-access memory, or RAM.  Computers and other electronic devices use RAM for high-speed data access.  The read\/write speed of RAM is typically several times faster than a mass storage device, such as a hard disk or SSD.  When a computer boots up, it loads the operating system into RAM.  Similarly, when you open an application on your computer or mobile device, it is loaded into RAM.  Loading the operating system and active applications into RAM allows them to run much faster.\nSince RAM is volatile memory, all data stored in RAM is lost when the host device is turned off or restarted.  The operating system must be loaded into RAM again when the device is turned on.  While this requires extra processing time during startup, the \"reset\" that non-volatile memory provides is an effective way to remove lingering issues that may occur while a computer is running.  This is why restarting a computer or electronic device is an effective way to fix common problems.\nSystem RAM is the most common type of volatile memory, but several other types exist.  Below are some examples of volatile memory:\n\nSystem RAM (DRAM)\nVideo RAM (VRAM)\nProcessor L1 and L2 cache\nHDD and SSD disk cache\n\nNOTE: The \"volatile\" aspect of the term \"volatile memory\" refers to how data is lost when the power is turned off.  It does not refer to the voltage required to maintain the data."

            "The word \"volume\" has several different meanings.  In physics, it measures both sound and three-dimensional space.  Audio volume defines the intensity of soundwaves, or how loud a sound is.  Spacial volume describes how much space a three-dimensional object takes up.  In the computer world, \"volume\" has an entirely different definition related to data storage.\nA computer volume is similar to a book volume, or a single book in a series.  It refers to a specific storage area, such as an HDD or SSD.  It may also be a section within a storage device.  Before a computer can access data from a volume, it must mount it first.  Once a volume is mounted, the computer may read and write data, depending on the volume's permissions.  Unmounting the volume prevents it from being accessed.\n While the terms \"volume\" and \"storage device\" are often used interchangeably, they do not have a one-to-one relationship.  For example, several storage devices can be linked together in a single volume.  Alternatively, a single storage device may be split into multiple volumes.\nContainers vs Volumes vs Partitions\nSome file systems, such as NTFS, use volumes as the top level of data storage.  Others, such as Apple's APFS, use \"containers.\"  A single disk may have multiple containers.  A container can store more than one volume and a volume may have multiple partitions.  It is also possible for a storage device to have one container with a single volume that has one partition.\nWhile a volume may contain multiple partitions, most file systems create separate volumes for each partition.  Windows, for example, creates a new volume for each partition, labeling each volume with a letter, such as C:, D:, E:, etc.  These volumes are also called \"drives,\" even though they may not be separate physical drives.\nNOTE: Since there is often a one-to-one relationship between volumes and partitions, these terms are also used interchangeably.  However, a partition is technically part of a volume.  For example, formatting a volume will erase all partitions contained in that volume."
