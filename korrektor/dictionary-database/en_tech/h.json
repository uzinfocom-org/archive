It is a local area network (LAN) within a home that may include both wired and wireless devices.\nThe central hub of a HAN is the router.  In most cases, the router is connected to a modem, which communicates with an ISP.  The modem provides an Internet connection to the router, which in turn provides Internet access to all connected devices within the home.\nSome modems include built-in routers, in which case the modem and router are the same device.\nBesides sharing the same Internet connection, devices on a HAN may communicate with each other.  For example, a laptop can transfer files to a desktop computer over a home network.  Similarly, a smartphone can cast videos to a smart TV if they are connected to the same router.\nIn larger homes, a HAN may include repeaters to extend the range of the wireless signal.  Both long distances and objects \u2014 especially cement walls \u2014 can cause Wi-Fi signals to degrade.  A weak wireless connection may still be useable, but it may be inconsistent and produce slow data transfer rates.  Wi-Fi repeaters or \"mesh networks\" solve this problem by boosting the signal in various areas of the home.\nPrevious generations of HANs mainly provided Internet access to multiple computers.  Modern HANs are the foundation of smart homes, which include many connected devices besides computers.  Examples include smartphones, TVs, thermostats, lights, sensors, and home assistants, such as Alexa and Google Home."

While \"high-definition\" has a broad scope, it can also refer to a specific HD resolution, such as 1920x1080 pixels.\nBefore HDTV was introduced in the late 1990s, the most common video resolutions were 640x480 (NTSC) and 720x576 (PAL and SECAM).  The NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) format was standard in the U.S. and Japan, while Europe and other parts of the world used PAL (Phase Alternating Line) or SECAM (Sequential Color and Memory). These resolutions became known as \"standard definition\" (SD) only after \"high definition\" (HD) was introduced.\nWhen HD devices first hit the market, there were three standard versions:\n\n720p - 1280x720 progressive scan\n1080i - 1920x1080 interlaced\n1080p - 1920x1080 progressive scan\n\nThe HD video formats listed above each have a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is wider than the 4:3 aspect ratio of standard definition.\n720p, also called \"HD ready,\" was the standard DVD video format, while 1080i and 1080p, called \"Full HD,\" were most often used HD broadcasts.  Since early HD televisions only supported 1080i, the standard HD broadcast format was 1080i.  It was not until Blu-ray discs became available that 1080p became standard.\nSince \"HD\" refers to any resolution greater than standard definition, it also encompasses higher resolutions like 4K and 8K.  However, to avoid ambiguity, 4K resolution (3840x2160) is typically called Ultra HD or UHD, while HD most often describes 1920x1080 video."

Most computers made in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s include an internal hard disk drive.  The first PCs had hard drives that were less than one megabyte in size, while modern hard drives may contain several terabytes of data.  Some desktop computers have multiple internal hard drives, and external hard drives are often used for additional storage or backup purposes.\nHDDs are non-volatile, meaning they do not need electrical power to maintain their data.  They store data magnetically using a series of spinning platters, or magnetic discs, which record individual bits as ones and zeroes.  Data is recorded using a write head that writes bits onto the disk.  A read head is used to read data from the disk.  Both of these heads are located at the end of a tapered metal component called an actuator arm.  The appearance is similar to a turntable, but the hard disk spins hundreds of times faster than a record.  Additionally, an HDD reads data digitally, while a record player captures an analog signal.\nHard disk drives come in many shapes and sizes, but 3.5 inch models are most common in desktop computers, and 2.5 inch models are usually found in laptops.  A typical consumer HDD has a rotational speed of 7200 RPM, but some high-end hard disk drives run as fast as 15,000 RPM.  Laptop HDDs typically run at either 4800 or 5400 RPM.  Even at the fastest rotational speed, hard drives are still limited by the \"seek time\" of the drive head.  Therefore, SSDs, which do not have a drive head, have become a popular high-performance alternative to HDDs in recent years."

It is supported by modern audio\/video equipment, such as 4K televisions, HDTVs, audio receivers, DVD and Blu-ray players, cable boxes, and video game consoles.\nWhile other types of A\/V connections require separate cables for audio and video data, a single HDMI cable carries the audio and video streams together, eliminating cable clutter.  For example, an analog component cable connection requires three cables for video and two for audio, totaling five cables in all.  The same information can be transmitted digitally using one HDMI cable.\nBecause HDMI is a digital connection, HDMI cables are less prone to interference and signal noise than analog cables.  Also, since most components, such as DVD players and digital cable boxes process information digitally, HDMI eliminates the digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion other interfaces require.  Therefore, HDMI typically produces the best quality picture and sound compared to other types of connections.\nHDMI cables are often more expensive than analog cables since they cost more to manufacture.  But it is important to remember that a single HDMI cable can replace multiple analog cables.  The single all-purpose connection simplifies setup and makes it easy to connect and disconnect devices.  It also supports digital commands, allowing devices to communicate with each other.  For example, if your TV is connected via HDMI to a receiver, the TV can automatically turn the receiver on and off when the TV is turned on and off.  It can also synchronize the volume between the TV and receiver.  Modern HDMI receivers allow you to visually configure the receiver settings using your TV as the interface.\nNOTE: HDMI is a trademark owned by HDMI Licensing Administrator, Inc.

            "Stands for \"High Dynamic Range.\"  HDR is a technology that improves the range of color and contrast in a digital image.  It may be used for both photos and videos, though the implementations are different.\nHDR Photography\nAn HDR photo is created my capturing multiple images with different exposures at the same time.  Instead of taking a single photo, the camera captures three or more photos in quick sequence using different exposure values.  For example, a digital camera might take one photo with a -1 exposure setting, one with the default (automatic) exposure, and one with a +1 exposure setting.  The camera (or smartphone) then combines the photos to create a single image.\nHDR image processing is useful when taking photos of scenes with high contrast.  For example, if you are standing in front of window during a sunny day, the backlight might cause the automatic exposure to be too low, making your face appear dark.  If you adjust the exposure to brighten your face, the window will become too bright \u2014 possibly completely white.  By combining multiple exposures, these levels can be averaged out, allowing your face to be visible in the photo while not overexposing the light behind you.\nMany digital cameras and smartphones, such as the iPhone, have an HDR option.  You can often choose from from three different HDR settings \u2014 OFF, ON, or Auto, which only takes an HDR photo in high-contrast situations.  Most cameras will also capture a regular photo at the same time, so you can choose between the HDR or regular photo for each HDR image captured.\nHDR Video\nHDR video is captured in a similar way to an HDR photo.  Each scene is recorded with different exposures (or different ISO settings) at the same time.  These scenes are blended together to create a single recording.  This typically results in a brighter video, though it can also create a grayish effect that may look unrealistic.  For this reason, HDR recordings are often modified in post-production before being published.\nIn order to display HDR video correctly, the output device (such as a TV or computer monitor) must also support HDR.  An HDR-capable TV, for example, must support certain video output standards.  These include 10-bit color and at least 90% of the DCI-P3 color space, a range of RGB colors defined by the American film industry.  An HDR display must also support specific HDR formats, such as HDR10, Dolby Vision, and Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG).  Most HDR televisions support all of these standards and can be updated using firmware updates that can be downloaded from the Internet."

            "Stands for \"High Definition Television.\"  HDTV is a high-quality video standard developed to replace older video formats often referred to as SDTV (standard definition television).  While HDTV's video quality is one of the most noticeable improvements over SDTV, HDTV includes a number of other important improvements as well.\nFirst of all, the HDTV signal is digital.  Instead of an analog signal, used by traditional NTSC broadcasts, HDTV is always digital.  This eliminates analog interference caused be electrical currents and magnetic fields.  Secondly, HDTV uses a different aspect ratio than SDTV.  While previous broadcasts used a 4:3 ratio (4 units wide for every 3 units tall), HDTV uses a ratio of 16:9.  This wider aspect ratio more closely emulates how humans see the world, making the image appear more realistic.  This ratio is also better for watching widescreen movies, which are recorded in widescreen for the same reason.\nTrue to its name, high definition television offers a much higher resolution than standard definition video.  While a typical analog broadcast in the U.S. contains a maximum of 525 horizontal lines of resolution, an HDTV signal supports up to 1080.  The three formats used by HDTV are 1080i (interlaced), and 720p and 1080p (progressive).  HDTV's higher resolution produces images that are much finer and contain more detail and more color than previous formats.  HDTV also provides a higher-quality digital audio signal than SDTV and supports up to six audio channels compared to the two channels allowed previously.\nTo watch HDTV, you need an HDTV-compatible television and a means of receiving an HDTV signal.  HDTVs come in both 16:9 and 4:3 formats (for backwards compatibility).  Some HDTVs include HDTV tuners for receiving over-the-air broadcasts, but others require the receiver to be bought separately.  Fortunately, most cable and satellite TV companies offer HDTV-compatible boxes with their digital service plans."

However, in the decade preceding HTML5, most websites were written in XHTML, a more strict version of HTML published in 2000.  HTML5 was designed to supersede both HTML 4 and XHTML by providing web developers with a simpler standard that includes several new features for the modern web.\nThe table below includes a list of new elements, or tags, introduced in HTML5 that are used to define the structure of a document.\n\nTagDescription\n&lt;header&gt;Defines the webpage header\n&lt;footer&gt;Defines the page footer\n&lt;nav&gt;Defines the navigation bar\n&lt;main&gt;Defines the main content of a webpage\n&lt;article&gt;Defines an article within a page\n&lt;section&gt;Defines a section of a document or article\n&lt;aside&gt;Defines content outside a page's primary content\n\nThese tags simplify the webpage's source as well as the corresponding CSS styles.  For example, in order to define a navigation element in XHTML, you would typically write \"&lt;div class=\"nav\"&gt; in the page's HTML and define a class called \".nav\" in CSS.  In HTML5, you can simply insert the &lt;nav&gt; tag in the HTML and style the element itself using CSS.\nHTML5 includes several other new tags as well.  Examples include &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;svg&gt; for graphics and &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; for multimedia elements.  These tags provide new capabilities for web developers, though it is important to note that HTML5 still relies heavily on CSS and JavaScript for page styling, animations, and user interaction.  Therefore, most interactive HTML5 websites are built using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript or jQuery.\nNOTE: Previous HTML standards included a space between the \"HTML\" and the number (i.e., HTML 1.0, HTML 4.01).

When viewed from a distance, the dots blur together, creating the illusion of continuous lines and shapes.  By halftoning an image (converting it from a bitmap to a halftone), it can be printed using less ink.  Therefore, many newspapers and magazines use halftoning to print pages more efficiently.\nOriginally, halftoning was performed mechanically by printers that printed images through a screen with a grid of holes.  During the printing process, ink passed through the holes in the screen, creating dots on the paper.  For monochrome images, only one pass was needed to create an image.  For multicolor images, several passes or \"screens\" were required.\nToday's printers are more advanced and typically do not contain physical screens.  Instead, the halftone images are generated by a computer and the resulting image is printed onto the paper.  By using a process called dithering, modern printers can randomize the dot patterns, creating a more natural appearance.  This produces realistic images using far less ink than fully saturated ones.\nLike a standard bitmap, the quality of a halftone image depends largely on the its resolution.  A halftone with a high resolution (measured in LPI), will have greater detail than a halftone with a low resolution.  While the goal of halftoning is typically to create a realistic image, sometimes low resolutions are used for an artistic effect."

The handshake confirms the identities of the connecting systems and allows additional communication to take place.\nHandshaking over a network is commonly called a 3-Way Handshake or \"SYN-SYN-ACK.\"  A successful handshake involves seven steps:\n\nHost A sends a synchronize (SYN) packet to Host B.\nHost B receives Host A's SYN request.\nHost B sends a synchronize acknowledgement (SYN-ACK) message to Host A.\nHost A receive's Host B's SYN-ACK message.\nHost A sends an acknowledge (ACK) message to to Host B.\nHost B receives Host A's ACK message.\nThe connection between the two systems is established.\n\nWhen a system initiates a handshake, there are three possible outcomes:\n\nNo response \u2013 If the system receiving the handshake is not available or does not support the protocol the initiating system uses, it may not respond to the request.\nConnection refused \u2013 The system receiving the handshake is available and understands the request, but denies the connection.\nConnection accepted \u2013 The system receiving the handshake is available, receives the request, and accepts the connection.\n\nThe third outcome listed above is the only the one in which the handshake is completed.  If a handshake is successful, the two systems can begin communicating and transferring (data) over the established protocol.  Examples of protocols that use handshaking include TCP, TLS, and SSL."

            "A hash is a function that converts one value to another.  Hashing data is a common practice in computer science and is used for several different purposes.  Examples include cryptography, compression, checksum generation, and data indexing.\nHashing is a natural fit for cryptography because it masks the original data with another value.  A hash function can be used to generate a value that can only be decoded by looking up the value from a hash table.  The table may be an array, database, or other data structure.  A good cryptographic hash function is non-invertible, meaning it cannot be reverse engineered.\nSince hashed values are generally smaller than the originals, it is possible for a hash function to generate duplicate hashed values.  These are known as \"collisions\" and occur when identical values are produced from different source data.  Collisions can be resolved by using multiple hash functions or by creating an overflow table when duplicate hashed values are encountered.  Collisions can be avoided by using larger hash values.\nDifferent types of compression, such as lossy image compression and media compression, may incorporate hash functions to reduce file size.  By hashing data into smaller values, media files can be compressed into smaller chunks.  This type of one-way hashing cannot be reversed, but it can produce an approximation of the original data that requires less disk space.\nHashes are also used to create checksums, which validate the integrity of files.  A checksum is a small value that is generated based on the bits in a file or block of data such as a disk image.  When the checksum function is run on a copy of the file (such as a file downloaded from the Internet), it should produce the same hashed value as the original file.  If the file does not produce the same checksum, something in the file was changed. \nFinally, hashes are used to index data.  Hashing values can be used to map data to individual \"buckets\" within a hash table.  Each bucket has a unique ID that serves as a pointer to the original data.  This creates an index that is significantly smaller than the original data, allowing the values to be searched and accessed more efficiently."

In order to tag a keyword in a Twitter post, simply type a number symbol (Shift+3) immediately before the word.  For example, you can tag the word \"tech\" in a tweet by typing \"#tech.\"\nTwitter automatically turns hashtagged words into links to a dynamic feed.  This feed is updated in real-time and lists all recent tweets containing the same hashtag.  When you post a tweet with a hashtag, your tweet will show up in the public feed.  Besides clicking on hashtags within tweets, you can also search for hashtags using Twitter's search feature.\nHashtags are used to categorize tweets, since all tweets with the same hashtag are related.  Therefore, searching for hashtags is a good way to monitor hot topics or trends.  For example, #marchmadness is popular during the March NCAA tournament, while #election might be popular during political elections.  Company names, such as #apple and #microsoft, are common hashtagged terms and may be used when people comment on new product releases.  As people post tweets with the same hashtag, the corresponding feed can easily turn into a discussion.\nA hashtag can be any word or combination or words and can also include numbers.  You can use trending hashtags in your tweets or make up your own.  However, it is best to use popular hashtags if you want others to see your tweet.  Each Twitter post can include multiple hashtags, though Twitter discourages spamming tweets with hashtags and recommends using no more than three hashtags per tweet.

Document Header\nMany word processing programs allow you to add a header and\/or footer to each page.  The header is a small area at the top of the document, while the footer is located at the bottom.  Document headers are often used to display the document title or company name at the top of each page.  By default, the header content is the same on all pages, so when you edit the header on one page, it will update on all the other pages as well.  If you break a document up into sections, you can specify different headers for each section.\nWord processors provide different ways of adding and editing header content.  Several programs allow you to select View &rarr; Headers and Footers to display the header and footer content.  Once visible, you can type new content inside each section.  Most version of Microsoft Word allow you to simply double-click in the header area to activate the header and add or edit text.  If you want to change the height of the header, you can open the Document Formatting window and modify the margins.\n2. Webpage Header\nThe header of a webpage typically includes the company or organization's logo, as well as the main navigation bar.  This section, which resides at the top of each webpage, is often part of a template and therefore is the same across all pages within a website or section of a website.  HTML 5 even includes a &lt;header&gt; tag that developers can use to specify the header section of each webpage.\nNOTE: A webpage header should not be confused with the &lt;head&gt; section in the HTML, which includes the page title, meta tags, and links to referenced files.\n3. File Header\nA file header is a small amount of data at the beginning of a file.  File headers vary between file formats, but they generally define the content of the file and list specific file attributes.  For example, the file header of a JPEG image file may include the image format, color profile, and application that created the file.  An MP3 audio file may include the song name, tagging format, and compression information.  You can view a file's header by dragging the file icon to a text editor and reading the first few lines.  While binary files may contain a lot of garbled characters, the header information is often still readable."

Smaller headphones, often called earbuds or earphones, are placed inside the outer part of your ear canal.\nLike speakers, headphones contain transducers that convert an audio signal into sound waves.  Headphones that connect to an analog audio port (such as a 3.5 mm audio jack) process analog audio.  Headphones that connect to a digital port, such as a USB or Lightning port process digital audio.  Digital headphones must also include a digital-to-analog converter, or DAC, in order to produce the analog output.\nWhile headphones function the same way as standalone speakers, their output is significantly different.  Speakers must generate enough amplitude for the sound to be audible from far away.  Headphones only need to send the sound waves a few millimeters to your ear drums.  Therefore headphone components are much smaller and often more precise than speaker components.  Even though the output is much lower than standalone speakers, the close proximity of headphones to your ears can make the volume sound very loud.  Most headphones even support the full 20 hertz to 20,000 Hz frequency range.  However, the bass is less noticeable since they don't move as much air.\nHeadphones come in many shapes and sizes, but a few common types are listed below.\n\nIn-ear - earphones that fit snuggly in your ear canal; typically contain rubber ends that help give them a secure fit.\nEarbuds - earphones that rest inside the edge of your ear; often included with smartphones and portable media players.\nOn-ear - headphones that rest on your ears but don't encompass the whole ear; helps isolate outside sounds.\nOver-ear - headphones that wrap around your ears; also called \"around-ear\" or \"circumaural\" headphones; come in open and closed versions.  Open versions allow all outside noise, while closed versions limit external sounds.\nNoise-cancelling - creates an extra quiet listening environment by canceling outside noise; contains a microphone that detects external sounds and sends the opposite waveform to your ear to \"cancel\" the noise; available in all types of form factors.\n"

Each node can have two or more child nodes, which means the heap becomes wider with each child node.  When displayed visually, a heap looks like an upside down tree and the general shape is a heap.\nWhile each node in a heap may have two or more child nodes (also called \"children\"), most heaps limit each node to two children.  These types of heaps are also called binary heaps and may be used for storing sorted data.  For example, a \"binary max heap\" stores the highest value in the root node.  The second and third highest values are stored in the child nodes of the root node.  Throughout the tree, each node has a greater value than either of its child nodes.  A \"binary min heap\" is the opposite, where the root node stores the lowest value and each node has a lower value than its children.\nIn computer science, heaps are often drawn as simple diagrams.  However, actually storing data in a heap is more complex.  In order to create a heap, programmers must write individual algorithms for inserting and deleting data.  The values inserted into a heap are typically stored in an array, which can be referenced by a program.  Since the data in a heap is already sorted, it provides an efficient means of searching for specific values.\nNOTE: \"The heap\" is also a programming term that may be used to describe dynamically allocated memory.

Since OpenSSL is used by roughly two-thirds of web servers, the vulnerability is considered one of the most significant security holes discovered since the beginning of the web.\nHow does Heartbleed work?\nThe Heartbleed exploit takes advantage of the initial communication between the client and server.  This preliminary step is commonly called a \"handshake,\" though OpenSSL provides a variation called a \"heartbeat.\"  The heartbeat is used to establish a secure connection, but the data transmitted during the heartbeat is not sent securely.\nBy sending false information to a server, a hacker can retrieve 64 kilobyte chunks of data from the server's cache.  While this is a small amount of data, it is enough to contain a username, password, or other confidential information.  By making several requests in a row, a hacker can potentially capture large amounts of private data cached in a server's memory.\nThe Heartbleed bug is specific to OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f and version 1.0.2-beta1.  Other versions of OpenSSL and other types of TLS (transport layer security) implementations are not affected.  After the bug was made known on April 7, many web servers were patched immediately with version 1.0.1g.  However, it is unknown how many servers were affected and how many still are using the vulnerable version of OpenSSL.\nHow does Heartbleed affect me?\nIt is unlikely that you are directly affected by the Heartbleed bug.  While the security hole went undetected for two years, there is little evidence that the exploit has been widely used.  Still, to be safe, you can protect yourself by updating your passwords for website logins, email accounts, and other online services."

Heat sinks can range in size from barely covering the processor to several times the size of the processor if the CPU requires it.\nMost heat sinks also have \"fins,\" which are thin slices of metal that are connected to the base of the heat sink.  These additional pieces of metal further dissipate the heat by spreading it over a much larger area.  A fan is often used to cool the air surrounding the heat sink, which prevents the heat sink from getting too hot.  This configuration is referred to as a heat sink and fan or HSF combination.

In computer science, a heuristic has a similar meaning, but refers specifically to algorithms.\nWhen programming software, computer programmers aim to create the most efficient algorithms to accomplish various tasks.  These may include simple processes like sorting numbers or complex functions such as processing images or video clips.  Since these functions often accept a wide range of input, one algorithm may perform well in certain cases, while not very well in others.\nFor example, the GIF image compression algorithm performs well on small images with few colors, but not as well as JPEG compression on large images with many colors.  If you knew you were only going to be dealing with small images that didn't have a wide range of colors, GIF compression would be all you need.  You wouldn't have to worry about large, colorful images, so there would be no point in optimizing the algorithm for those images.  Similarly, computer programmers often use algorithms that work well for most situations, even though they may perform inefficiently for uncommon situations.\nTherefore, a heuristic process may include running tests and getting results by trial and error.  As more sample data is tested, it becomes easier to create an efficient algorithm to process similar types of data.  As stated previously, these algorithms are not always perfect, but work well most of the time.

Source code written in scripting languages like Perl and PHP can be run through an interpreter, which converts the high-level code into a low-level language on-the-fly."

            "A hit is a metric used in website analytics.  While \"hits\" and \"visits\" are sometimes used interchangeably, they are two different things.  A visit is recorded when a user visits a webpage.  A hit is recorded for each resource that is downloaded from a web server.  Therefore, it is common for hits to outnumber visits, often by a ratio of more than 10 to 1.\nMost webpages reference multiple files, such as images, CSS documents, and JavaScript files.  Each local file referenced in the HTML counts as a hit, along with the webpage itself.  Therefore, if a page includes eight images, references two CSS documents, and links to three JavaScript files, it would record 14 hits each time a visitor views the page.\nBecause website hits can vary depending on how many resources each page contains, the metric is rarely used to measure website traffic.  Instead, most webmasters track other metrics, such as visitors, unique visitors, and page views.\nNOTE: The term \"hits\" can also refer to the number of search engine results for a specific query.  For example, if you perform a Google search that generates 300,000 results, you could say the query produced 300,000 hits."

Since the home page file is loaded automatically from the root directory, the home page URL does not need need to include the filename.\nThere is no standard home page layout, but most home pages include a navigation bar that provides links to different sections within the website.  Other common elements found on a home page include a search bar, information about the website, and recent news or updates.  Some websites include information that changes every day.

The name \"honeypot\" is used in reference to the way the system traps unauthorized users, such as hackers or spammers so they can be identified and prevented from causing further problems.\nHoneypots are different than typical security solutions because they intentionally lure in hackers or users with malicious intent.  For example, a company may purposely create a security hole in their network that hackers could exploit to gain access to a computer system.  The system might contain fake data that would be of interest to hackers.  By gaining access to the data, the hacker might reveal identifying information, such as an IP address, geographical location, computer platform, and other data.  This information can be used to increase security against the hacker and similar users.\nAnother example of a honeypot is an email honeypot designed to counteract spammers.  It may be configured as a fake email address that is intentionally added to known spam lists.  The email address can be used to track the servers and relays that send spam to the honeypot account.  This information can be used to blacklist certain IP addresses and domain names in anti-spam databases.  An email honeypot can even be used as a counterattack tool, which forwards spam to the email addresses of identified spammers.\nWhile honeypots are an effective way to monitor and protect information systems, they can also be expensive to maintain.  Therefore, honeypots are used primarily by large companies and organizations, rather than small businesses.  Government and educational institutions may also deploy research honeypots as a means of tracking unauthorized access attempts and improving security solutions."

Each host has a unique identifier called a hostname that allows other computers to access it.\nDepending on the network protocol, a computer's hostname may be a domain name, IP address, or simply a unique text string.  For example, the hostname of a computer on a local network might be Tech-Terms.local, while an Internet hostname might be techterms.com.  A host can access its own data over a network protocol using the hostname \"localhost.\"\nHost vs Server\nThe terms host and server are often used interchangeably, but they are two different things.  All servers are hosts, but not all hosts are servers.  To avoid confusion, servers are often defined as a specific type of host, such as a web host or mail host.  For instance, a mail host and mail server may refer to the same thing.\nWhile a server refers to a specific machine, a host may also refer to an organization that provides a service over the Internet.  For example, a web host (or web hosting company) maintains multiple web servers and provides web hosting services for clients.  A file host may provide online storage using multiple file servers.  In other words, a hosting company hosts multiple servers that serve data to clients."

For example, if your name your Mac, \"Mike's iMac\", the hostname will automatically be translated to \"Mikes-iMac.local\".  If you're a Mac user, you can customize your computer's hostname by modifying the computer name in the Sharing System Preference.  If you use a Windows PC, you can modify your hostname by changing the computer name within the System Control Panel.\nInternet hostnames are simply domain names, like techterms.com.  They are typically fully qualified domain names, such as www.techterms.com or ftp.techterms.com, since each subdomain is a different hostname.  However, if a website URL does not include a domain prefix like \"www,\" then the domain name itself (e.g. \"techterms.com\") can serve as the hostname.\nIn both local networks and wide area networks like the Internet, hostnames are translated to IP addresses using DNS.  Either a local or remote DNS server maps each hostname to a unique IP address, which is how the device is actually identified on a network.  Therefore, hostnames are simply used as human-readable labels, which makes it easy to remember names of devices on a network and websites on the Internet."

            "In electronics terminology, the word \"hot\" is often used to mean \"active\" or \"powered on.\"  Therefore, a hot swappable device is a peripheral or component that can be removed or added while a computer is running.  Replacing a device while a computer is powered on is called \"hot swapping.\"\nMost early I\/O devices were not hot swappable.  This is because early ports, such as parallel ports and SCSI ports did not support connecting or removing devices while the computer was powered on.  In fact, removing devices from these older ports while the computer was running could cause damage to them or the computer.  Since it was hassle for users to turn off their computers each time they needed to connect or reconnect a device, newer I\/O ports were designed to be hot swappable.  Modern ports that support hot swapping include USB, FireWire, and Thunderbolt.\nMost modern PCs include only hot swappable ports.  Therefore, the term is now used most often to describe internal components that can be replaced while the computer is running.  A common example is a server hard drive.  Since servers need to run constantly to avoid downtime, they typically support hot swappable hard drives.  Rack-based servers often provide easy access to one or more hard drives on the front face of the rack unit.  This allows server administrators to quickly add more storage or replace old hard drives without powering down the server.\nNOTE: Except for rare exceptions, RAM is generally not hot swappable."

Network hub\nA network hub is a device that allows multiple computers to communicate with each other over a network.  It has several Ethernet ports that are used to connect two or more network devices together.  Each computer or device connected to the hub can communicate with any other device connected to one of the hub's Ethernet ports.\nHubs are similar to switches, but are not as \"smart.\"  While switches send incoming data to a specific port, hubs broadcast all incoming data to all active ports.  For example, if five devices are connected to an 8-port hub, all data received by the hub is relayed to the five active ports.  While this ensures the data gets to the right port, it also leads to inefficient use of the network bandwidth.  For this reason, switches are much more commonly used than hubs.\n2. USB hub\nA USB hub is a device that allows multiple peripherals to connect through a single USB port.  It is designed to increase the number of USB devices you can connect to a computer.  For example, if your computer has two USB ports, but you want to connect five USB devices, you can connect a 4-port USB hub to one of the ports.  The hub will create four ports out of one, giving you five total ports.  The USB interface allows you to daisy chain USB hubs together and connect up to 127 devices to a single computer.\nSome USB hubs include a power supply, while others do not.  If you're connecting basic devices like a mouse, keyboard, and USB flash drive, an unpowered or \"passive\" USB hub should work fine.  However, some peripherals, like external hard drives and backlit keyboards, require additional electrical power.  In order for these types of devices to function through a USB hub, you may need use a powered or \"active\" hub that provides 5 volts of power to connected devices."

Since hyper-threading allows two streams to be executed in parallel, it is almost like having two separate processors working together.\nWhile hyper-threading can improve processing performance, software must support multiple processors to take advantage of the technology.  Fortunately, recent versions of both Windows and Linux support multiple processors and therefore benefit from hyper-threading.  For example, a video playing in Windows Media Player should not be slowed down by a Web page loading in Internet Explorer.

It can also limit how many system resources each VM can use so that multiple VMs can run simultaneously on a single system.\nThere are two primary types of hypervisors: native and hosted.\nType-1: Native\nA native or \"bare metal\" hypervisor runs directly on the hardware.  It sits between the hardware and one or more guest operating systems.  A native hypervisor loads even before the OS and interacts directly with the kernel.  This provides the highest possible performance since there is no primary operating system competing for the computer's resources.  However, it also means the computer may only be used to run virtual machines since the hypervisor is always running.  Examples of Type-1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Apple Boot Camp.\nType-2: Hosted\nA hosted hypervisor is installed on a host computer, which already has an operating system installed.  It runs as an application like other software on the computer.  Most hosted hypervisors can manage and run multiple VMs at one time.  The advantage of a hosted hypervisor is that it can be open or quit as needed, freeing up resources for the host computer.  However, since it runs on top of an operating system, it may not offer the same performance as a native hypervisor.  Examples of Type-2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop for Mac.\nGenerally, hosted hypervisors are more common for personal and small business use, while native hypervisors are used for enterprise applications and cloud computing."
