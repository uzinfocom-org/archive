It is a Free Software project developed by hundreds of software programmers across the world.  Both the KDE source code and the software itself are made freely available to the public.\nKDE's primary benefit is the modern graphical user interface GUI it provides for Unix workstations.  While Unix systems are notoriously difficult for novice users to operate, KDE makes it possible for the average user to work on a Unix system.  In addition to the modern interface, KDE also includes several user-friendly features, such as an application help system and standardized menus and toolbars.  It also supports the ability to customize the interface with various skins or themes.\nAnother important aspect of the K Desktop Environment is its application development framework, which is what software engineers use to develop programs for KDE.  Since a desktop environment is only as useful as the applications available for it, it is important that developing software for the environment is not a tedious process. Therefore, the KDE application development framework has been designed to help programmers develop robust applications in a simple and efficient manner.  This has led to the development of KOffice and hundreds of high-quality programs for KDE."

            "Stands for \"Keyboard, Video, and Mouse switch.\"  As the name implies, a KVM switch allows you to used multiple computers with the same keyboard, video display, and mouse.  Now, most of us don't need to use two computers at once.  In fact, using one computer at a time can sometimes be a challenge.  However, there are situations where using a single keyboard, mouse, and display with multiple machines can be very practical.\nFor example, software programmers may use a KVM switch to alternate between two or more computers with different operating systems.  This allows them to test their software on multiple platforms when developing a crossplatform application.  Network administrators often use KVM switches to monitor and control multiple servers at a time.  These KVM switches may support eight or more computers at once.  By simply pressing a button on the KVM switch, the administrator can view the display of any machine connected to the switch and control it with a single keyboard and mouse.\nOf course, KVM switches can also be used by the everyday home user.  Some people may find it useful to have two computers at their desk, such as a home and work computer, or a Mac and a PC.  In these situations, a KVM switch can accommodate both machines, allowing them to share the same monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  Because only one of each is needed, the result is far less clutter on the desk.  This leaves room for stacks of papers, mail, and other objects to clutter up the rest of the desk.\nSince most keyboards and mice use a USB connection, most KVM switches include USB ports.  Older models may include PS\/2 or serial ports.  The connection for the monitor may be a VGA or DVI port, or both.  If you plan on using a KVM switch for your computer setup, make sure the ports match the display and input devices you are going to use with it."

For example, dial-up modems were rated by their maximum download speeds, such as 14.4, 28.8, and 56 Kbps.  Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Kbps remained the standard way to measure data transfer dates.  However, broadband connections such as cable and DSL now offer speeds of several megabits per second.  Therefore, Mbps is more ubiquitous than Kbps.\nNOTE: The lowercase \"b\" in Kbps is significant.  It stands for \"bits,\" not bytes (which is represented by a capital \"B\").  Since there are eight bits in one byte, 400 Kbps is equal to 400 \u00f7 8, or 50 KBps.  Because data transfer speeds have traditionally been measured in bps, Kbps is more commonly used than KBps."

Servers running HTTP\/1 often have keep-alive turned on to improve website performance.  The keep-alive header is not used in HTTP\/2 since it is the default behavior of the HTTP\/2 protocol.\nWhen Keep-Alive is enabled on a web server, it creates persistent connections between the server and clients (website visitors).  The TCP connection stays open until it is closed or times out.  Since each TCP connection must complete a handshake process, multiple connections increase the page load time.  Keep-Alive provides a way for browsers to download all webpage assets, such as images and CSS files, over a single connection.\nThe disadvantage of Keep-Alive is that it requires more system resources from the web server.  If websites on a server receive a lot of traffic, it may have several \u2014 possibly several thousand \u2014 persistent connections open at once.  Eventually, the server may not be able to handle new connections and become unresponsive.  Apache provides the following directives to prevent servers from reaching maximum capacity:\n\nKeepAliveTimeout - the maximum time a persistent connection can stay open while waiting for new requests\nMaxKeepAliveRequests - the maximum number of requests allowed within a single connection, before it needs to be reset\n\nTo enable keep-alive on an Apache server, add the following code to a server-wide include file or the .HTACCESS file of a specific website:\n[cb]\n\n    Header set Connection keep-alive\n\n[\/cb]"

            "A kernel is the foundational layer of an operating system (OS).  It functions at a basic level, communicating with hardware and managing resources, such as RAM and the CPU.\nSince a kernel handles many fundamental processes, it must be loaded at the beginning of the boot sequence when a computer starts up.  The kernel performs a system check and recognizes components, such as the processor, GPU, and memory.  It also checks for any connected peripherals.  As the OS loads and the graphical user interface appears, the kernel keeps running.  Even after the OS has fully loaded, the kernel continues to run in the background, managing system resources.\nTypes of Kernels\nSeveral types of kernels exist, but two popular ones include monolithic kernels and microkernels.  A monolithic kernel is a single codebase, or block of source code, that provides all the necessary services offered by the operating system.  It is a simplistic design and creates a well-defined communication layer between the hardware and software.\nMicrokernels have the same function as monolithic kernels, but they are designed to be as small as possible.  Instead of managing all the resources from a single codebase, the kernel handles only the most basic functions.  It uses modules or \"servers\" to manage everything else.  For example, device drivers are typically included in a monolithic kernel, but they would be split into separate modules in a microkernel.  This design is more complex, but it can provide a more efficient use of system resources and helps protect against system crashes.\nKernel Panics\nSince the kernel handles the most basic functions of a computer, if it crashes it can take down the entire computer.  This undesirable event is called a \"kernel panic\" on macOS and Unix systems.  It is similar to the blue screen of death in Windows.  The only way to recover from a kernel panic is to restart your computer.\nNOTE: Kernel panics are often caused by hardware communication issues.  Therefore, if your computer is producing repeated kernel panics, try unplugging unnecessary devices to see if that fixes the problem."

            "Kerning refers to the spacing between the characters of a font.  Without kerning, each character takes up a block of space and the next character is printed after it.  When kerning is applied to a font, the characters can vertically overlap.  This does not mean that the characters actually touch, but instead it allows part of two characters to take up the same vertical space.\nFor example, when the characters A and V are placed next to each other, they can take up less total space if they overlap.  This is because the right part of the A and the left part of the V fit together.  If kerning is applied to the two characters, you could draw a vertical line straight down starting from the top left part of the V and it would go through the lower right part of the A.\nKerning is useful because it allows more text to be placed within a given amount of space.  This allows longer articles to be placed in newspapers and magazines with limited space.  It also looks more natural because when writing by hand, people often make characters overlap.  Many text editing programs, as well as image editors such as Adobe Photoshop, allow the user to kern characters.  These programs often include a kerning setting that enables the user to determine how tightly the characters fit together."

This keyboard layout is known as the QWERTY design, which gets its name from the first six letters across in the upper-left-hand corner of the keyboard.\nWhile the design of computer keyboards may have come from typewriters, today's keyboards have many other keys as well.  Modifier keys, such as Control, Alt\/Option, and Command (Mac) or the Windows key (Windows) can be used in conjunction with other keys as \"shortcuts\" to perform certain operations.  For example, pressing Command-S (Mac), or Control-S (Windows) typically saves a document or project you are working on.  Most of today's computer keyboards also have a row of function keys (F1 through F16) along the top of the keyboard, arrow keys arranged in an upside-down T, and a numeric keypad on the right-hand side.

The shortcut for copying data is usually \"Control-C\" (Windows) or \"Command-C\" (Mac) and for pasting data, it is \"Control-V\" (Windows) or \"Command-V\" (Mac).\nMost keyboard shortcuts are shortcuts for commands located in a program's menu bar.  For example, most of the commands within the File and Edit menus have standard shortcuts.  Each command that has a keyboard shortcut usually has the shortcut listed next to the command in the menu.  For example, the Save option in a Windows program will usually have the text \"Ctrl+S\" next to it, indicating that pressing Control and S together will save the document.\nWhile most keyboard shortcuts are located in a program's menu bar, there are many keyboard shortcuts that are sometimes not visible to the user.

A user may \"tag\" pictures or text files with keywords that are relevant to their content.  Later on, these files may be searched using keywords, which can make finding files much easier.  For example, a photographer may use a program like Extensis Portfolio or Apple iPhoto to tag his nature photos with words such as \"nature,\" \"trees,\" \"flowers,\" \"landscape,\" etc.  By tagging the photos, he can later locate all the pictures of flowers by simply searching for the \"flowers\" keyword.\nKeywords are used on the Web in two different ways: 1) as search terms for search engines, and 2) words that identify the content of the website.\n1) Search Engine Search Terms\nWhenever you search for something using a search engine, you type keywords that tell the search engine what to search for.  For example, if you are searching for used cars, you may enter \"used cars\" as your keywords.  The search engine will then return Web pages with content relevant to your search terms.  The more specific keywords you use, the more specific (and useful) the results will be.  Therefore, if you are searching for a specific used car, you may enter something like \"black Honda Accord used car\" to get more accurate results.\nMany search engines also support boolean operators that can be used along with keywords to further refine the search.  For example, you may search for \"Apple AND computers NOT fruit\" if you only want results related to Apple products and not the kind of apples that grow on trees.\n2) Web Page Description Terms\nKeywords can also describe the content of a Web page using the keyword meta tag.  This tag is placed in the &lt;head&gt; section of a page's HTML and contains words that describe the content of the Web page.  The purpose of the keywords meta tag is to help search engines identify and organize Web pages, like in the photos example above.

Therefore, if you download an 800 KB file at 400 Kbps, it will take 16 seconds (rather than 2).  This is because 400 kilobits per second is equal to 50 kilobytes per second."
