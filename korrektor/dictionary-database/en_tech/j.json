            "Stands for \"Java Database Connectivity.\"  JDBC is an API that allows Java applications to connect to and query a wide range of databases.  Examples include Java DB, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, Sybase ASE, and Microsoft SQL Server.\nJDBC makes it possible for a software developer to run SQL queries within a Java application.  The database connection and any required query translations are handled by the JDBC driver.  For example, the same Java method can be used to query a MySQL database and a Microsoft SQL Server database.  The goal is to provide developers with \"write once, run anywhere\" functionality, making it easy to work with different types of databases.\nIn order for an application to use JDBC, the appropriate driver must be installed.  Examples include the JDBC Thin driver and the JDBC OCI (Oracle Call Interface) driver.  The driver files are available as Java archives (.JAR files), which can be referenced by a Java application.  Each Java archive contains .CLASS files that allow Java apps to communicate with different types of databases.  Individual classes can be removed to reduce the disk space required by the corresponding Java app.\nJDBC drivers are maintained and provided by Oracle, which took over the development of Java after acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010.\nWhat is the difference between JDBC and ODBC?\nJDBC is designed specifically for Java applications, while ODBC is language independent.  That means the ODBC API is available for multiple programming languages, while JDBC is only available for Java.  A \"bridge\" can be used to translate commands between the two APIs.  For example, an ODBC-JDBC bridge translates ODBC function-calls into JDBC method-calls, allowing them to be processed by a JDBC driver.  A JDBC-ODBC driver converts JDBC method calls into ODBC function calls, allowing them to work with an ODBC driver."

            "Stands for \"Journaled File System.\"  JFS is a 64-bit file system created by IBM.  The initial version of JFS (also called JFS1) was developed for IBM's AIX operating system and was released in 1990.  In 2001, IBM released JFS2 (the Enhanced Journaled File System), as well as a version of JFS that is compatible with the Linux operating system.\nThe \"journaled\" aspect of JFS means that the file system keeps tracks of changes to files and folders in a log file (or journal).  This log can be used to backtrack certain changes in case of an unexpected power failure or system crash, which may prevent data corruption.  For example, if a file is in the process of being moved or deleted when a computer crashes, the journal can be used to restore the file to its last stable state.  Without the journal, the file may be truncated, which would make it unreadable and could produce other file system errors.\nThe Enhanced Journaled File System (JFS2) is similar to JFS, but supports much larger volumes and file sizes.  For example, a hard disk formatted using JFS can be a maximum of one terabyte (TB) in size, while a JFS2-formatted disk can be up to 32 TB.  JFS's maximum file size is slightly less than 64 gigabytes (GB), while JFS2 supports file sizes up to 16 TB.  This large file capacity is especially important for storing large databases, which are often contained in a single file.\nNOTE: JFS2 is supported by AIX 5.1 and later.  It is also supported on Linux systems that have the \"jfsutils\" package installed."

            "Stands for \"Joint Photographic Experts Group.\"  JPEG is a popular image file format.  It is commonly used by digital cameras to store photos since it supports 224 or 16,777,216 colors.  The format also supports varying levels of compression, which makes it ideal for web graphics.\nThe 16 million possible colors in a JPEG image are produced by using 8 bits for each color (red, green, and blue) in the RGB color space.  This provides 28 or 256 values for each of the three colors, which combined allow for 256 x 256 x 256 or 16,777,216 colors.  Three values of 0 produce pure black, while three values of 255 create pure white.\nThe JPEG compression algorithm may reduce the file size of a bitmap (BMP) image by ten times with almost no degradation in quality.  Still, the compression algorithm is lossy, meaning some image quality is lost during the compression process.  For this reason, professional digital photographers often choose to capture images in a raw format so they can edit their photos in the highest quality possible.  They typically export the pictures as JPEG (.JPG) images when they are shared or published on the web.\nBesides image data, JPEG files may also include metadata that describes the contents of the file.  This includes the image dimensions, color space, and color profile information, as well as EXIF data.  The EXIF data is often \"stamped\" on the image by a digital camera and may include the aperture setting, shutter speed, focal length, flash on\/off, ISO number, and dozens of other values.\nDisadvantages of the JPEG Format\nWhile the JPEG format is great for storing digital photos, it does have some drawbacks.  For example, the lossy compression can cause an issue called \"artifacting,\" in which parts of the image become noticeably blocky.  This typically happens when a high compression setting is used to save the image.  For saving small images and images with a lot of text, the GIF format is often a better alternative.  JPEG images also don't support transparency.  Therefore, the JPEG format is a poor choice for saving non-rectangular images, especially if they will be published on webpages with different background colors.  The PNG format, which supports transparent pixels is more ideal for these types of images.\nNOTE: The Joint Photographic Experts Group, which the JPEG image format is named after, published the first JPEG specification in 1992.  Since then, the organization has developed several variations of the format, including JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR.  However, the standard JPEG format remains the most popular.\nFile extensions: .JPG, .JPEG, .JFIF, .JPX, .JP2"

For example, instead of coding a Web form in HTML, a developer can instead call a simple JSF function that generates the form.  Another JSF function may be used to process the data entered by the user.  These functions are processed on the server and the resulting data is output to the client's browser.\nJSF benefits developers by providing reusable objects that can easily be inserted into webpages.  However, these components are also beneficial to website visitors since they produce standardized interface elements.  Since the Java code is processed on the server, the appearance of the generated Web objects is consistent across multiple websites.  Additionally, JSF components are tested on multiple platforms, so they work well in all major browsers.\nWhile JSF is often used to create basic webpage elements, it also supports advanced features, such as database access, Ajax interaction, and JavaScript page actions.

This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server.  For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out.  The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.\nLike server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage.  However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage.  It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.\nBelow is an example of a basic JavaScript function that adds two numbers.  The function is called with the parameters 7 and 11.  If the code below were included in the HTML of a webpage, it would display the text \"18\" in an alert box.\n&lt;script&gt;\n&nbsp; function sum(a,b)\n&nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; return a + b;\n&nbsp; }\n&nbsp; var total = sum(7,11);\n&nbsp; alert(total);\n&lt;\/script&gt;\nJavaScript functions can be called within &lt;script&gt; tags or when specific events take place.

            "Jitter, in networking, refers to small intermittent delays during data transfers.  It can be caused by a number of factors including network congestion, collisions, and signal interference.\nTechnically, jitter is the variation in latency \u2014 the delay between when a signal is transmitted and when it is received.  All networks experience some amount of latency, especially wide area networks that span across the Internet.  This delay, typically measured in milliseconds, can be problematic for real-time applications, such as online gaming, streaming, and digital voice communication.  Jitter makes this worse by producing additional delays.\nNetwork jitter causes packets to be sent at irregular intervals.  For example, there may be a delay after some packets are sent and then several packets may be sent all at once.  This may cause packet loss if the receiving system is unable to process all the incoming packets.  If this happens during a file download, the lost packets will be resent, slowing down the file transfer.  In the case of a real-time service, like audio streaming, the data may simply be lost, causing the audio signal to drop out or decrease in quality.\nThe standard way to compensate for network jitter is to use a buffer that stores data before it is used, such as a few seconds of an audio or video clip.  This will smooth out the playback of the media since it gives the receiving computer a few seconds to receive any packets lost due to jitter.  While buffers are an effective solution, they must be extremely small when used in real-time applications such as online gaming and video conferencing.  If the buffer is too large (greater than 10 ms), it will cause a noticeable delay."

Some websites host their own local copy of jQuery, while others simply reference the library hosted by Google or the jQuery server.

Common examples include modifying text, processing form data, moving elements on a page, and performing animations.  jQuery can also work with Ajax code and scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP to access data from a database.

A common example is \"autocomplete,\" in which a search form automatically displays common searches as you type your query.  In fact, this is how TechTerms.com provides search suggestions when you type in the search box.\nBesides its free license, the other main reason jQuery has gained such popularity is its cross-browser compatibility.  Since each browser renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript differently, it can be difficult for a web developer to make a website appear the same across all browsers.  Instead of having to write custom functions for each browser, a web developer can use a single jQuery function that will work in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.  This multi-browser support has led many developers to switch from standard JavaScript to jQuery, since it greatly simplifies the coding process.\nYou can read more about jQuery and download the latest library at the official jQuery website."
