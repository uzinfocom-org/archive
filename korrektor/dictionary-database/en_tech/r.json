            "Stands for \"Redundant Array of Independent Disks.\"  RAID is a method of storing data on multiple hard disks.  When disks are arranged in a RAID configuration, the computer sees them all as one large disk.  However, they operate much more efficiently than a single hard drive.  Since the data is spread out over multiple disks, the reading and writing operations can take place on multiple disks at once.  This can speed up hard drive access time significantly.  Multiple hard drives may not improve hard disk performace as much as multiple processors may enhance the CPU performance, but it is based on a similar logic.\nThe benefits of RAID come from a technique called \"striping,\" which splits up the stored data among the available drives.  The \"stripes\" of data are usually a couple of megabytes large and are interleaved between the drives.  The striping system also increases the mean time between failure (MTBF), when reading data.  This allows more data to be read accurately in a short period of time.  The benefits of the RAID system are especially noticeable when storing large amounts of data.  Therefore, many Web hosting and Internet Service Providers use RAID to store data for their clients."

In computers, RAM may be installed as memory modules, such as DIMMs or (SO-DIMMs\nsodimm).  In tablets and smartphones, RAM is typically integrated into the device and cannot be removed.\nThe amount of RAM in a device determines how much memory the operating system and open applications can use.  When a device has sufficient RAM, several programs can run simultaneously without any slowdown.  When a device uses close to 100% of the available RAM, memory must be swapped between applications, which may cause a noticeable slowdown.  Therefore, adding RAM or buying a device with more RAM is one of the best ways to improve performance.\n\"RAM\" and \"memory\" may be used interchangeably.  For example, a computer with 16 GB of RAM has 16 gigabytes of memory.  This is different than storage capacity, which refers to how much disk space the device's HDD or SSD provides for storing files.\nSystem memory is considered \"volatile\" memory since it only stores data while a device is turned on.  When the device is powered down, data stored in the RAM is erased.  When the device is restarted, the operating system and applications load fresh data into the system memory.  This is why restarting a computer often fixes problems."

Tables may also be related to other tables.  The relational structure makes it possible to run queries across multiple tables at once.\nWhile a relational database describes the type of database an RDMBS manages, the RDBMS refers to the database program itself.  It is the software that executes queries on the data, including adding, updating, and searching for values.  An RDBMS may also provide a visual representation of the data.  For example, it may display data in a tables like a spreadsheet, allowing you to view and even edit individual values in the table.  Some RDMBS programs allow you to create forms that can streamline entering, editing, and deleting data.\nMost well known DBMS applications fall into the RDBMS category.

This makes it possible to quickly scan several items or to locate a specific product surrounded by many other items.\nRFID tags have many different uses.  Some examples include:\n\nMerchandise tags - These tags are attached to clothing, electronics, and other products to prevent theft from retail stores.  These tags are typically deactivated at the place of checkout.  Tags that have not been deactivated will sound the alarm system near the store's exit.\nInventory management - Products stored in warehouses may be given RFID tags so they can be located more easily.\nAirplane luggage - RFID tags may be placed on checked bags so they can be easily tracked and located.\nToll booth passes - E-ZPass and I-Pass receivers may be placed in automobiles, allowing cars and trucks to pass through toll booths without needing to stop.  This enables drivers to make toll payments automatically.\nCredit cards - Some credit cards have built-in RFIDs so they can be \"waved\" rather than \"swiped\" near compatible readers.

Combining red, green, and blue light is the standard method of producing color images on screens, such as TVs, computer monitors, and smartphone screens.\nThe RGB color model is an \"additive\" model.  When 100% of each color is mixed together, it creates white light.  When 0% of each color is combined, no light is generated, creating black.  It is sometimes contrasted with CMYK (cyan, yellow, magenta, and black), the standard color palette used to create printed images.  CMYK is a \"subtractive\" color model since the colors get darker as they are combined.  Blending 100% of each color in the CMYK color model produces black, while 0% of each color results in white.\nHow many colors can be created using RGB?\nThe number of colors supported by RGB depends on how many possible values can be used for red, green, and blue.  This is known as \"color depth\" and is measured in bits.  The most common color depth is 24-bit color, also known as \"true color.\"  It supports eight bits for each of the three colors, or 24 bits total.  This provides 28, or 256 possible values for red, green, and blue.  256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 total possible colors in the \"true color\" palette.\nThe human eye can only distinguish about seven million colors, so color depths above 24-bit are rarely used.\nRGB Example\nWhen displaying a color image on a screen, each pixel has a specific RGB value.  In 24-bit color, this value is between 0 and 255, where 0 is no color and 255 is full saturation).  A purple pixel will have a lot of red and blue, but little to no green.  For example, the following RGB value might be used to create purple:\nR: 132 &nbsp; (84 in hexadecimal)\nG: 17 &nbsp; (11 in hexadecimal)\nB: 170 &nbsp; (AA in hexadecimal)\nSince each color has 256 possible values, it can also be represented using two hexadecimal values (16 x 16), as shown above.  The standard way to display an RGB value is to use the hexadecimal values for red, green, and blue, preceded by a number symbol, or hashtag.  Therefore, the purple color above is defined in RGB as #8411AA."

Each router uses this table to determine the most efficient way to route data.  RIP incorporates distance-vector routing, which calculates the best path based on the direction and distance between routers.  Each packet is forwarded to the appropriate routers until the packet reaches its destination.\nRIP also prevents endless routing loops by limiting the number of \"hops\" between the source and destination.  A hop is recorded each time a packet is forwarded from one router to another.  The maximum number of hops allowed by RIP is 15.  If the hop count hits 16, RIP determines the destination is not reachable and the transfer is terminated.\nThree different versions of RIP exist:\n\nRIPv1 - standardized in 1988; uses \"classful\" routing, which defines an IP class, but does not include subnet information\nRIPv2 - developed in 1993 and standardized in 1998; uses \"classless\" routing and carries subnet information; supports MD5 authentication\nRIPng - standardized in 1997; an extension of RIPv2 that supports IPv6\n\nNOTE: Most modern networks use newer routing methods, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), rather than RIP to route data."

A RISC processor may complete more operations per second than a CISC processor running at the same clock speed.\nRISC processors simplify pipelining (performing multiple instructions at once) compared to CISC processors.  Smaller instructions are easier to synchronize or \"pipeline\" than larger ones.\nSince RISC processors store fewer instructions than their CISC counterparts, less transistors are required to store instructions.  Therefore, RISC processors can use more transistors to store memory.\n\nCPU transistors are now a fraction of the size they were two decades ago, so storing fewer instructions is less advantageous.

Impression RPM, or ad unit RPM, measures the revenue per 1,000 impressions of a specific ad unit.  If a webpage only has one banner ad, the page RPM and impression RPM will be identical.  If a page has more than one ad unit (which is often the case), the individual ads will typically have lower impression RPMs than the page RPM.  If certain ads have low RPMs, a publisher may replace or remove them with the goal of generating higher page RPMs.\nPage RPM vs eCPM\nIn some cases, RPM and CPM are used interchangeably.  While CPM means \"Cost Per 1,000 Impressions,\" some advertising platforms use CPM in publisher reports instead of RPM.  Specifically, the metric \"eCPM\" or \"effective CPM\" is sometimes used in place of \"page RPM.\"  While \"page RPM\" is more accurate, \"eCPM\" in a publisher advertising report means the same thing.\nRevolutions Per Minute\nOutside of advertising, RPM typically stands for \"Revolutions Per Minute.\"  In hardware specifications, RPM may refer to fan speed or hard drive rotational speed.

A race condition may happen if a program checks the logic gate result before variables A and B are loaded.

            "Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents you from using your computer or accessing certain files unless you pay a ransom.  It often encrypts your files so that they cannot be opened.  Examples of ransomware include Locky, Reveton, CryptoLocker, and CryptoWall.\nRansomware is often distributed as a trojan, or malware disguised as a legitimate file.  Once installed, it may lock your computer and display a \"lockscreen\" with a message saying you must pay a ransom to regain use of your computer.  This may be a fake message purporting to be from a government institution like the FBI or Department of Defense saying you must pay a fine.  It may also be a blatant ransom message saying your files are being held for ransom and you must pay to access them again.  The ransom message typically includes instructions for how to pay the fine, often by credit card or Bitcoin.  Ransom amounts range from less than $100 to several thousand dollars.\nSome ransomware may allow you to use your computer, but will prevent you from opening certain files.  When you try to open a file or directory encrypted by the ransomware, you may see a message or alert box stating your files are being held for ransom and you must pay a fee to regain access to them.\nDealing with Ransomware\nThe best way to deal with ransomware is to prevent it.  Don't open unknown files or downloads from untrusted websites.  You may also want to install antivirus or Internet security software that can detect and eliminate ransomware threats before they take over your computer.  This is especially true if you use Windows, as it is the platform most commonly targeted by ransomware.\nIf your computer is infected with ransomware, you have a few options.\n\nIf you have a recent system backup, you can revert to a saved state before the ransomware infected your computer.\nSearch for an Internet security utility that can remove the specific ransomware installed on your system and possibly decrypt your files.\n(Not recommended) Pay the ransomware fee and contact your bank or credit card company to block or refund the transaction.\n\nNOTE: TechTerms does not recommend paying a ransom to remove ransomware.  There is no guarantee that paying the fee will remove the ransomware for your computer.  The best way to recover from a ransomware attack is to restore your files from a recent backup."

For example, a 640 x 480 image requires information to be stored for 307,200 pixels, while a 3072 x 2048 image (from a 6.3 Megapixel digital camera) needs to store information for a whopping 6,291,456 pixels.\nSince raster graphics need to store so much information, large bitmaps require large file sizes.  Fortunately, there are several image compression algorithms that have been developed to help reduce these file sizes.  JPEG and GIF are the most common compressed image formats on the Web, but several other types of image compression are available.\nRaster graphics can typically be scaled down with no loss of quality, but enlarging a bitmap image causes it to look blocky and \"pixelated.\"  For this reason, vector graphics are often used for certain images, such as company logos, which need to be scaled to different sizes.\nFile extensions: .BMP, .TIF, .GIF, .JPG"

The most common in personal computing is a backup storage device.  While most other computer components can be easily replaced, if a hard drive fails, it may not be possible to recover personal data.  Therefore, it is important to regularly back up your data to a secondary hard drive.  In enterprise situations, a RAID configuration can be used to mirror data across two drives in real-time.\nAnother type of redundant device is a secondary power supply.  High traffic web servers and other critical systems may have multiple power supplies that take over in case the primary one fails.  While an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is not technically a redundant device, the battery within the surge protector provides power redundancy for a few minutes if electricity is lost.\nComputer networks often implement redundancy as well.  From local area networks to Internet backbone connections, it is common to have redundant data paths.  This means if one system goes down, the connection between other systems will not be broken.  For example, an FDDI network has a duplicate data \"ring\" that is used automatically when the primary data path is interrupted.

Some monitors support refresh rates of over 100 Hz.\nThe higher the refresh rate, the less image flicker you will notice on the screen.

If the refresh rate is too slow, this flicker can be hard on your eyes and may cause them to tire quickly.  As if sitting at a computer for several hours wasn't hard enough!\nTo avoid flicker, you should set your monitor to use the maximum refresh rate possible.  This setting is found in the Monitors control panel in Windows and the Displays system preference in Mac OS X.

Lower resolutions (i.e. 800x600) typically support higher refresh rates than higher resolutions (i.e. 1600x1200).\nIf you have an LCD monitor, you may not be able to adjust the refresh rate.

For example, a data register may store individual values referenced being by a currently running program.  An address register contains memory addresses, which reference different blocks of memory within the system RAM.

Regular expressions were originally used by Unix utilities, such as vi and grep.  However, they are now supported by many code editing applications and word processors on multiple platforms.  Regular expressions can also be used in most major programming languages.\nA regular expression can be as simple as a basic string, such as \"app\".  The regex \"app\" would match strings containing the words \"apps,\" \"applications,\" and \"inapplicable\".  A regular expression may also contain anchor characters (\"^\" and \"$\") which are used to specify the beginning and end of a line, respectively.  Therefore, the regex \"^apps\" would match the string, \"apps are great,\" but would not match the string, \"I like apps.\"\nRegular expressions can include dashes, which are used to match a range of characters, such as all lowercase letters.  For example, the regex \"[a-z]\" would match \"apps,\" but would not match the strings \"Apps\" or \"123\".  The regex \"[A-Za-z]\" would match \"Apps\" and \"[0-9]\" would match \"123\".  A period, which is the standard wildcard character in regular expressions, can be used to match any character (except an end-of-line character).  A period followed by an asterisk (.*) matches zero or more instances, while a period followed by a plus (.+) matches one or more instances.\nSo what happens if you need to match a string containing a dash, asterisk, plus, or an anchor character?  These characters can be included in a regular expression pattern by \"escaping\" them with a backslash (\"\\\").  For example, to search for \"$0.99\", the regex would look like \"\\$0\\.99\".  Backslashes are also used to search for non-printable characters.  For example, \"\\r\" matches a carriage return, \"\\n\" matches a new line, and \"\\t\" matches a tab character.\nWhile it does not take much effort to create a basic regular expression, writing an advanced regex is not an easy task.  Even the best programmers rarely get complex regular expressions right the first time.  When used correctly, however, regular expressions are a powerful tool for searching, finding, and replacing specific text."

System administrators, on the other hand, may reimage business computers using standard disk images instead of backup files.  This ensures all computers within a department have the same data.\nReimaging is a useful system restore method, since it rebuilds a hard drive with the exact content saved in the disk image.  This includes all the folders and files as well as the hard disk file system information.  Therefore, reimaging is one-step process, which doesn't require multiple installations.  While the term \"reimage\" is sometimes used synonymously with an OS reload (or operating system reinstallation), it technically refers only to the process of restoring data from a disk image.\nReimage is also the name of a Windows PC hard disk repair utility."

            "A relational database is a database model that stores data in tables.  The vast majority of databases used in modern applications are relational, so the terms \"database\" and \"relational database\" are often used synonymously.  Likewise, most database management systems (DBMSes) are relational database management systems (RDBMSes).  Other database models include flat file and hierarchical databases, though these are rarely used. \nEach table in a relational database contains rows (records) and columns (fields).  In computer science terminology, rows are sometimes called \"tuples,\" columns may be referred to as \"attributes,\" and the tables themselves may be called \"relations.\"  A table can be visualized as a matrix of rows and columns, where each intersection of a row and column contains a specific value.  It is \"relational\" since all records share the same fields.\nDatabase tables often include a primary key, which provides a unique identifier for each row within the table.  The key may be assigned to a column (which requires a unique value each row), or it may be comprised of multiple columns that together form a unique combination of values.  Either way, a primary key provides an efficient way of indexing data and can be used to share values between tables within a database.  For example, the value of a primary key from one table can be assigned to a field in a row of another table.  Values imported from other tables are called foreign keys.\nThe standard way to access data from a relational database is through an SQL (Structured Query Language) query.  SQL queries can be used to create, modify, and delete tables, as well as select, insert, and delete data from existing tables."

Graphics\n3D graphics are rendered from basic three-dimensional models called wireframes.  A wireframe defines the shape of the model, but nothing else.  The rendering process adds surfaces, textures, and lighting to the model, giving it a realistic appearance.  For example, a 3D drawing application or a CAD program may allow you to add different colors, textures, and lighting sources to a 3D model.  The rendering process applies these settings to the object.\nThanks to the power of modern GPUs, 3D image rendering is often done in real-time.  However, with high-resolution models, surfaces and lighting effects may need to be rendered using a specific \"Render\" command.  For example, a CAD program may display low-resolution models while you are editing a scene, but provide an option to render a detailed model that you can export.\n2. Video\n3D animations and other types of video that contain CGI often need to be rendered before viewing the final product.  This includes the rendering of both 3D models and video effects, such as filters and transitions.  Video clips typically contain 24 to 60 frames per second (fps), and each frame must be rendered before or during the export process.  High-resolution videos or movies can take several minutes or even several hours to render.  The rendering time depends on several factors including the resolution, frame rate, length of the video, and processing power.\nWhile video clips often need to be pre-rendered, modern GPUs are capable of rendering many types of 3D graphics in real-time.  For example, it is common for computers to render high-definition video game graphics at over 60 fps.  Depending on the graphics power, a game's frame rate may be faster or slower.  If the GPU cannot render at least 30 frames per second, the video game may appear choppy.\n3. Audio\nLike video effects, audio effects can also be rendered.  For example, a DAW application may include effects like reverb, chorus, and auto-tune.  The CPU may be able to render these effects in real-time, but if too many tracks with multiple effects are being played back at once, the computer may not be able to render the effects in real-time.  If this happens, the effects can be pre-rendered, or applied to the original audio track.  All effects are rendered when the final mix is exported or \"bounced\" as an audio file."

By amplifying the signal, a repeater increases the transmission range of the original signal.\nRepeaters have many applications, but in computing they are most commonly used in wireless networks.  For example, a Wi-Fi network in a large home may benefit from using one or more repeaters to relay the signal to different areas of the house.  Homes that have brick walls or cement floors may also benefit from having a repeater relay the signal around the obstacle.  Businesses often use a series of repeaters to create a single wireless network within a large building.\nWhile repeaters all serve the same purpose, they come in many forms.  Some wireless devices, often called \"range extenders\" are designed to be used specifically as repeaters.  Other devices, such as hubs, switches, and routers can all be configured as repeaters using a software utility or web interface that controls the wireless device.\nNOTE: Since repeaters only relay an incoming signal, using a router as a repeater does not make use of its signal routing capability.

The trunk contains the current version of a software project.  This may include multiple source code files, as well as other resources used by the program.  Branches are used to store new versions of the program.  A developer may create a new branch whenever he makes substantial revisions to the program.  If a branch contains unwanted changes, it can be discontinued.  Otherwise, it can be merged back into the trunk as the latest version.  Tags are used to save versions of a project, but are not meant for active development.  For example, a developer may create a \"release tag\" each time a new version of the software is released.\nA repository provides a structured way for programmers to store development files.  This can be helpful for any type of software development, but it is especially important for large development projects.  By committing changes to a repository, developers can quickly revert to a previous version of a program if a recent update causes bugs or other problems.  Many version control systems even support side-by-side comparisons of different versions of files saved in the repository, which can be helpful for debugging source code.

One or more resistors can be used to provide the correct amount of current to specific components within an electronic device.\nResistors are often soldered onto a printed circuit board to limit the amount of current that flows to different electrical paths.  If too little current reaches a component, it may not operate.  If too much current is allowed through, it can damage the component.  Therefore, resistors play an important role in an electronic circuit.\nSeveral types of resistors exist, but most are made up of carbon and an insulating material, such as ceramic.  The current flows in one end and the remaining current flows out the other.  The resulting current is inversely proportional to the resistance.  This is defined in Ohm's law, which states that the current (I) is equal to the voltage (V) divided by the resistance (R).\nI = V \/ R\nResistors are often color-coded to visually represent their resistance levels.  A typical axial-lead resistor, for instance, is cylindrical in shape and has several colored stripes.  The first few stripes represent digits, followed by a stripe which represents a multiplier (10x, 100x, etc.)  On the other end is a stripe that represents the tolerance, which defines the accuracy of the resistor.  Some resistors also include one more band that represents the temperature coefficient.\nNOTE: Resistors are represented in circuit diagrams by a jagged line.  They are usually labeled R1, R2, R3, etc."

Multiplying these numbers together produces 7,164,160 total pixels.  Since the photo contains just over seven million pixels, it is considered a \"7 megapixel\" image.  Digital camera resolution is often measured in megapixels, which is simply another way to express the image resolution.\n\"Resolution\" is often used synonymously with \"size\" when describing the dimensions of a digital image.  However, the term \"size\" can be a bit ambiguous, since it may refer to the file size of the image or its dimensions.  Therefore, it is best to use \"resolution\" when describing the dimensions of a digital image.\nDisplay Resolution\nEvery monitor and screen has a specific resolution.  As mentioned above, an HD display has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.  A 4K display has twice the resolution of HD, or 3840 x 2160 pixels.  It is called \"4K\" since the screen is nearly 4,000 pixels across horizontally.  The total number of pixels in a 4K display is 8,294,400, or just over eight megapixels.\nMonitor resolution defines how many pixels a screen can display, but it does not describe how fine the image is.  For example, a 27\" iMac 5K display has a resolution of 5120 x 2880 while an older 27\" Apple Thunderbolt Display has exactly half the resolution of 2560 x 1440.  Since the 27\" iMac is the same physical size as the Thunderbolt Display but has twice the resolution, it has twice the pixel density, measured in pixels per inch, or PPI.\nNOTE: Unlike monitor resolution, the resolution of a printer or scanner is analogous to pixel density rather than total pixels.

For example, a responsive website may appear one way on a laptop, another way on a tablet, and still another way on smartphone.\nToday, many people access websites from mobile devices, rather than desktop computers or laptops.  While most smartphones can display regular websites, the content is difficult to read and even harder to navigate.  Therefore, many web developers now use responsive web design to provide a better web browsing experience on small screens.\nWebsites designed for mobile devices (such as iOS and Android phones), typically have a larger default font size and simplified navigation.  Some sites also take advantage of the touchscreens interface, providing support for swiping, rotating, and pinching and zooming.  A mobile-optimized website may also remove unnecessary content to reduce the need for scrolling.  Image rollovers and other mouse hover features are often removed, since touchscreens don't support a mouse pointer.\nThere are several ways to implement responsive web design.  One method is to dynamically detect the user's platform (such as an iPad or iPhone) and load specific HTML and CSS for the corresponding device.  Another option is to use media queries, which automatically load different CSS styles depending on the size of the browser window.  The Bootstrap package, which contains several prewritten JavaScript and CSS files, is based on media queries and is commonly used in responsive web design."

When a display has a resolution over 300 dpi, most humans cannot recognize individual pixels when viewing the screen from a distance of about 12 inches.  Therefore, the pixels seem to run together, creating a smooth appearance.  This is similar to digital audio that is recorded with a high sampling rate.  Since the audio samples are so close together, we perceive the sound as a smooth analog signal.\nSince some people have better vision than others, there is no scientifically accurate number that defines a retina display.  In fact, some people may in fact be able to identify individual pixels in a retina display.  Still, compared to a typical computer monitors, which has a resolution of 72 dpi, a retina display will look noticeably sharper to all users.\nRetina displays are especially useful for reading text on a small screen, such as an iPhone or iPod Touch.

            "A rootkit is a software program designed to provide a user with administrator access to a computer without being detected.  Rootkits are considered one of the most serious types of malware since they may be used to gain unauthorized access to remote systems and perform malicious operations.\nThe name \"rootkit\" includes the word \"root,\" because the goal of a rootkit is to gain root access to a computer.  By logging in as the root user of a system, a hacker can perform nearly any operation he or she wishes.  This includes installing software and deleting files.  The word \"kit\" refers to the software files that make up the rootkit.  These may include utilities, scripts, libraries, and other files.\nRootkits often work by exploiting security holes in operating systems and applications.  Others create a \"back door\" login to the operating system, which allows a user to bypass the standard login procedure when accessing a system.  Once root access has been enabled, a rootkit may attempt to hide any traces of unauthorized access by modifying drivers or kernel modules, hiding certain files, and quitting active processes.\nFortunately, most operating systems and software programs are designed to prevent unauthorized access via rootkits or other malware.  Therefore, it is difficult to use a rootkit to gain access to modern systems.  However, rootkits are constantly modified and updated in order to try and breach security holes.  Therefore, it is wise to install antivirus or other security software on your computer to monitor any attempts of unauthorized access to your system."

            "When Apple switched from PowerPC to Intel processors in 2006, it was important that programs written for PowerPC processors would still run on the new Intel-based Macs.  Therefore, Mac OS X for Intel computers included Rosetta, a technology that enables PowerPC programs to run on Intel processors.\nRosetta dynamically translates PowerPC instructions into Intel commands.  Users can't see Rosetta running, but it is active any time a PowerPC program is running on an Intel-based Mac.  Since translating instructions from one processor to another takes some time, PowerPC applications may run slower on Intel-based Macs.  Fortunately, the slowdown is minimal and may not even be noticed by most users.\nYou can check if an application uses Rosetta by selecting the application icon and choosing \"Get Info\" from the File Menu (Command-I).  Underneath the \"General\" section, if the Kind is listed as \"Application,\" it is a PowerPC program, which will require Rosetta to run.  If it is listed as \"Application (Universal),\" the program is a Universal application, meaning it was developed to run natively on both PowerPC and Intel computers.  You can also check what currently running programs use Rosetta by opening Activity Monitor in the \/Applications\/Utilities folder.  Underneath the \"Kind\" column, each process will be listed as either Intel or PowerPC.  Those that are listed as PowerPC are currently using Rosetta to run."

For example, a row (or record) from a Employee table may contain an employee's name, address, position, salary, and other information.  When querying a database, the results are typically returned as an array of rows, which is similar to a group of records.  Individual values can be accessed by selecting a specific column (or field) within a row.  \nNOTE: When displaying data in a table format, the top row is often called the table header.

            "While in the physical world, \"ruby\" refers to a red gemstone, in the computer world, ruby is an object-oriented programming language.  If a special woman in your life asks for a ruby for her birthday, I would recommend choosing the gemstone for the gift.\nThe Ruby programming language was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto and is named after the birthstone of one his colleagues.  Interestingly, the pearl (as in the Perl language) is the June gemstone, while ruby is the July gemstone.  This makes the subtle suggestion that Ruby is a step forward from Perl.\nLike Perl, Ruby's strength lies in it's simplicity.  The syntax is very basic and it is completely object-oriented.  This means every type of data handled by the language is treated as an object, even data types as simple as integers.  The source code can be interpreted by the official Ruby interpreter or by JRuby, a Java-based interpreter.\nRuby is an open-source language, like PHP, which means it is free to download and use.  It can be compiled and run on just about any operating system, including Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X.  For more information on Ruby and to download the Ruby software, visit the Ruby Home Page."

            "Runtime is the period of time when a program is running.

It is commonly seen in the context of a \"runtime error,\" which is an error that occurs while a program is running.  The term \"runtime error\" is used to distinguish from other types of errors, such as syntax errors and compilation errors, which occur before a program is run.\nWhen a program is in the runtime phase, the application is loaded into RAM.  This includes the executable file and any libraries, frameworks, or other files referenced by the program.  When the program is quit, the runtime period ends and the memory used by the program is made available for use by other programs."

            "A runtime error is a program error that occurs while the program is running.  The term is often used in contrast to other types of program errors, such as syntax errors and compile time errors.\nThere are many different types of runtime errors.  One example is a logic error, which produces the wrong output.  For example, a miscalculation in the source code or a spreadsheet program may produce the wrong result when a user enters a formula into a cell.  Another type of runtime error is a memory leak.  This type of error causes a program to continually use up more RAM while the program is running.  A memory leak may be due to an infinite loop, not deallocating unused memory, or other reasons.\nA program crash is the most noticeable type of runtime error since the program unexpectedly quits while running.  Crashes can be caused by memory leaks or other programming errors.  Common examples include dividing by zero, referencing missing files, calling invalid functions, or not handling certain input correctly.\nNOTE: Runtime errors are commonly called referred to as \"bugs,\" and are often found during the debugging process, before the software is released.  When runtime errors are found after a program has been distributed to the public, developers often release patches, or small updates, designed to fix the errors."
