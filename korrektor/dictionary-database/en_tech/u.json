For this reason, the U unit measures how tall a rack-mountable hardware device is.\n1U is equal to 1.75 inches.  Therefore, a 1U piece of equipment is 1.75 inches tall and takes up one unit of rack space.  A 2U device is 3.5 inches tall and takes up 2 units of rack space.  Racks themselves are also measured in U.  For example, a 10U rack could store 10 1U devices or 5 2U devices.  It could also store 3 3U devices, with just enough space left over for your miniature Star Wars action figure."

It involves running a product through a series of specific tests that help indicate whether or not the product will meet the needs of its users.  While the user acceptance testing process can be applied to any type of product, in the computer industry, it is most often associated with software programs.\nSoftware applications typically go through multiple development stages before being released to the general public.  These stages include the initial development process, the alpha testing stage, the beta testing stage, the release candidate stage, and the public release of the software.  Not every software program goes through each one of these stages, but most software programs are tested by multiple users before they are released.\nThe primary UAT stages of software development include the alpha and beta testing stages.  In the alpha testing stage, a limited number of users within (and possibly outside) a company test an early version of software for bugs and user interface issues.  In the beta testing stage, a larger group of users (usually outside the company) test the software and provide feedback, including bug reports and usability issues.  This feedback lets the software company know if the product is meeting user expectations and enables the development team to make the necessary revisions before the official release.\nBecause software is relatively easy to modify and update (unlike hardware products), user acceptance testing may continue even after a software program is released.  Many programs now include feedback and bug submission forms directly within the software, which allow users to provide feedback as they use the software."

It is managed by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Forum, comprised of more than 250 member companies.  The standardized UEFI specifications are designed to ensure that components from different hardware manufacturers can be recognized and controlled via the UEFI.\nAccessing the UEFI\nThe UEFI is designed for advanced users, so by default it is not displayed during the startup process.  The standard way to load the UEFI on most Windows PCs is to press the F2 key when the computer is starting up.  Typically, you should press the key when the manufacturer's logo (such as \"Dell\" or \"HP\") appears.  In Windows 8 and 10, you can also use the Troubleshoot option to enable \"UEFI Firmware Settings\" before the next restart.\nConfiguration options provided in the UEFI vary depending on the manufacturer and computer model.  Typically, you can perform administrator tasks like formatting and partitioning storage devices.  You may also be able to change your boot disk and activate or deactivate specific peripherals.  Some systems even allow you to overclock your CPU or run your PC in a low-power \"eco-friendly\" mode.\nWarning: Since the UEFI gives you administrative control over low-level settings, it is possible to make changes that may harm your computer.  Therefore, use discretion when making any changes within the UEFI.  If the computer does not function correctly after starting up (e.g., the fans run too fast), you can restart and use the UEFI to revert your changes.\nNOTE: Intel-based Macs use EFI to manage the hardware configuration, but the UEFI is not available at startup."

These bars can be scanned by a laser device or camera that quickly reads and interprets the sequence into the corresponding 12-digit number.  When you check out at a retail store, the UPC is used to identify and record each item you purchase.\nThe first digit in a UPC code represents the country of origin (0 for the United States) and the next five digits identify the manufacturer.  Digits 7 through 11 identify the specific product.  The twelfth digit serves as checksum, which checks the validity of the preceding 11 numbers.\nUPCs vs Other Product Identifiers\nSKUs\nUPCs and SKUs both identify specific products, but UPCs \u2014 as the name implies \u2014 are more universal.  Manufacturers must apply for a range of UPCs, which identify their products globally for distribution by any retailer.  SKUs can be generated by any retailer as an alternative to UPCs.  They provide retailers with a custom means of identifying products they sell.\nProduct IDs\nUPCs and product IDs (PIDs) both uniquely identify products, but product IDs are generated by each manufacturer.  PIDs allow manufacturers to keep records of their products using their own IDs rather than universal product codes.  Many products have both the UPC and product ID printed on the label.\nSerial Numbers\nWhile UPCs identify products, serial numbers (SNs) identify each individual item manufactured.  For example, a specific type of wireless bluetooth headphones may have a single UPC, but each item sold will have a unique serial number.

Smaller UPS devices look like bulky power strips, while larger ones may stand upright and look almost like small computers.  Many businesses use uninterruptible power supplies to keep their equipment running in case of a power failure.  While a UPS may only keep a computer running for 15 minutes after the power is lost, it is usually sufficient time to save all necessary documents and properly shut down the computer.  That extra time can be invaluable to someone who is working on an important document or project that has not been recently saved.\nBecause UPS devices run the power through a battery, they have a limit on the wattage load they can support.  The maximum power load limit is often included in the name of the UPS, followed by the letters \"VA.\"  For example, the APC (American Power Conversion) Battery Backup 750VA has a load limit of 750VA.  However, the maximum wattage a UPS supports is typically 60% of the VA number.  So the 750VA UPS supports a maximum of 450 watts for connected devices.

As long as a product supports UPnP, it can communicate with other UPnP devices within a network.  The connections are typically created using the DHCP networking protocol, which assigns each connected device a unique IP address.\nWhile UPnP is helpful for setting up networks, it also can be used to set up compatible audio and video (AV) devices.  UPnP AV is a group of standards based on UPnP that allows audio and video components to be connected via network connections.  This enables media files and streaming data to be sent between devices.  For example, a movie stored on a hard drive in a bedroom could be played back on the TV screen in the living room.  The central controller of a UPnP AV network is called a MediaServer and can be run from a Macintosh, Windows, or Linux computer or from a hardware device specifically designed to manage the network.\nSince most UPnP devices support zero-configuration setup (like ordinary Plug and Play devices), it is simple to add devices to a network and use them immediately.

            "Ultrabook\u2122 is an Intel trademark that describes a laptop specification.  Notably, ultrabooks have an Intel CPU, SSD storage, and a thin unibody frame.  They have a maximum height (when closed) and therefore do not have an optical drive, such as a DVD player.\nThe initial Ultrabook spec was announced in 2011, which included an Intel \"Sandy Bridge\" processor, a maximum height of 21mm, 5-hour battery life, a maximum 7-second resume-from-hiberation time, and Intel's Anti-Theft Technology.  The 2012 update required a minimum \"Ivy Bridge\" Intel processor, USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt ports, and a minimum data transfer rate of 80 MBps.  The 2013 Ultrabook update increased the minimum processor to a \"Haswell\" Intel processor and required 6 hours of high-definition video playback.\nAs with many trademarked terms, \"Ultrabook\" is often used generically.  For example, many people refer to thin and lightweight laptops as ultrabooks.  However, an Ultrabook only refers to laptops that meet Intel's specifications.\nSince laptops have gotten thinner and most no longer have optical drives, Ultrabooks are not as exclusive as they once were.  However, if you are shopping for a new laptop, it can still be helpful to check if the laptop meets the requirements of an Ultrabook."

The Undo command allows you to undo the last action you performed in the program.  Many programs also include a \"multiple undo\" feature, which allows several actions to be undone in series.  You can typically reverse an \"Undo\" command by selecting \"Redo\" from the Edit menu.\nThe Undo command can undo a wide variety of actions, depending on the program.  For example, in a word processor, Undo is often used to delete a recently typed section of text.  However, you can also undo a deletion, the pasting of an object, or a change made to the page formatting settings.  In an image editing program, you can undo a paintbrush stroke, a selection, the moving of an object, and many other actions.  Modern operating systems allow you to undo moving and renaming files.\nUndo is a convenient feature, which can save a lot of time and frustration for those of us who are not perfect and occasionally make mistakes.  Perhaps that's why the shortcut was designed to be so easy to use (Z is right next to the Control and Command keys).  So, whenever you make a mistake while using a program, just enter the Undo shortcut and the mistake is gone.  If only the Undo command could be used in other areas of life as well."

While ASCII only uses one byte to represent each character, Unicode supports up to 4 bytes for each character.\nThere are several different types of Unicode encodings, though UTF-8 and UTF-16 are the most common.  UTF-8 has become the standard character encoding used on the Web and is also the default encoding used by many software programs.

            "An uplink port is a port on a router or switch designed to connect to another router or switch or an Internet access device.  Most home routers include an uplink port for connecting a cable or DSL modem.\nAn uplink port looks like a standard Ethernet port, which is a female jack for an RJ45 connector.  However, there are two primary differences between the uplink port and other ports on a router or switch:\n\nThe uplink port reverses the transmit and receive connectors.\nThe uplink port may support more bandwidth than the other Ethernet ports.\n\nConnector Reversal\nWhen you connect a desktop computer or laptop to a standard port on a router, the Transmit pins from the Ethernet cable connect directly to the Receive pins inside the port.  This is known as a \"straight-through\" connection since the data simply passes through the router.  Similarly, the Transmit pins inside the port connect directly to the Receive pins on the connected Ethernet cable.\nWhen attaching a router to a cable modem, switch, or another router, the Receive and Transmit terminals must be altered to function correctly.  One option is to use a \"crossover cable,\" which reverses four of the eight wires.  Another option is to use an uplink port, which does this automatically.\nGreater Bandwidth\nMany routers and switches provide extra bandwidth through the uplink port to avoid data congestion.  For example, a router may have four 1 Gbps Ethernet ports and one 2.5 Gbps uplink port.  A switch may have sixteen 1 Gbps Ethernet ports and one 10 Gbps uplink port.\nSince all incoming and outgoing traffic flows through the uplink port, it is important that it provides more bandwidth than the rest of the individual ports.  Standard ports rarely use 100% of their maximum bandwidth at the same time, so the uplink port bandwidth is usually less than the combined bandwidth of the rest of the ports.\nUsing the Uplink Port\nMost modern routers have an uplink port on the back.  This port is often labeled \"Internet\" or has a circle icon that indicates it should connect to an Internet device, such as a cable or DSL modem.  On switches, the uplink port is often labeled \"Uplink\" since it often connects to another switch or router.\nNOTE: Some routers support \"Auto-MDIX,\" which detects if a connection is straight-through or crossover.  You can connect a modem to an Auto-MDIX port without a crossover cable, but it may not provide the extra bandwidth of an uplink port."

            "Uptime describes how long or how reliably a system has been running.  It may be defined as an absolute value (e.g., 64 days) or a percentage (e.g., 99.5%).  Uptime percentage is a common metric used to determine the reliability of a web server.\nAbsolute uptime measures the length of time a system has been running since it was booted.  For example, if a system was rebooted at 1:00 PM and is still running at 3:30 PM the next day, its uptime will be 26.5 hours.  When a system is restarted, the uptime number resets.\nOn a Unix-based system (including macOS), you can view the system uptime by typing the uptime command in the terminal.\nUptime percentage is determined by dividing the total time has been available (or online) by the time it has been active.  For example, if a web server has been active for one year, but was not available for a total of 32 hours during the year, its uptime percentage would be calculated as follows:\n365 days x 24 hours = 8,760 active hours\n8,760 active hours - 32 hours unavailable = 8,728 available hours\n8,728 available hours \u00f7 8,760 active hours = 99.6347% uptime\nAn uptime of 99.9% is a reasonable goal for a web server.  That percentage may sound high, but even a few hours of downtime can have a significant impact on a business.  For this reason, a high-traffic enterprise server may have an uptime goal of 99.999%.  This level of uptime can be achieved by using multiple servers for redundancy and load balancing."

As the Internet grew in popularity, so did Usenet, extending online discussions to countries around the globe.\nWhile Usenet was designed for text-based discussions, it evolved to support file sharing as well.  Today, Usenet is commonly used to distribute files (or \"binaries\" since the files may contain any type of binary data).  Examples include videos, songs, pictures, and software programs.

In the technology world, this often refers to a hardware device or software program.  A positive user experience is simple, intuitive, and enjoyable.  A negative user experience is complex, confusing, and frustrating.\nSuccessful companies focus on creating a high-quality user experience.  When a user enjoys using a product, he or she is likely to continue using the product and may recommend it to other people.  Conversely, if a product frustrates a user, he or she may switch to another product and tell others to avoid using it.  Therefore, producing a positive user experience benefits both the company and the end user.\nThe focus of UX design is the user, rather than the product itself.  The goal is to meet or exceed user expectations rather than to simply deliver a product.  A product that provides a positive user experience is:\n\nfunctional\nintutive\neasy-to-use\nreliable\nenjoyable\n\nSoftware UX\nA software application that provides a good UX has an intuitive user interface.  This means a typical user can learn the program by simply using it, rather than reading a manual or taking lessons.  For example, a program with intuitive icons and simple menu bar options may be easy for a new user to understand.  However, if a developer creates a program with non-standard icons and complex menu options, it will make the program less intuitive, likely resulting in a negative user experience.\nWebsite UX\nA website with a good UX is easy to view and simple to navigate.  The font should be easy to read and the content should be clearly separated from any advertisements on the page.  There should not be any unexpected popups or distracting animations on the page.  The navigation should simple, which often includes a navigation bar at the top of the window as well as clear links within the content.  Responsive design can help provide a good UX for both desktop and mobile users.\nIf you want to create a website with a positive user experience, it may help to follow these web design rules.\nUser experience is often associated with information technology, but it applies to all products.  For example, automotive manufacturers strive to create a positive user experience for drivers.  Retail stores aim to provide a positive user experience for customers.  Since user needs and wants are constantly evolving, companies must listen and respond to user feedback.  Successful companies continually update their products and services to meet customer expectations."

This means the program includes graphical controls, which the user can select using a mouse or keyboard.  A typical GUI of a software program includes a menu bar, toolbar, windows, buttons, and other controls.  The Macintosh and Windows operating systems have different user interfaces, but they share many of the same elements, such as a desktop, windows, icons, etc.  These common elements make it possible for people to use either operating system without having to completely relearn the interface.  Similarly, programs like word processors and Web browsers all have rather similar interfaces, providing a consistent user experience across multiple programs.\nMost hardware devices also include a user interface, though it is typically not as complex as a software interface.  A common example of a hardware device with a user interface is a remote control.  A typical TV remote has a numeric keypad, volume and channel buttons, mute and power buttons, an input selector, and other buttons that perform various functions.  This set of buttons and the way they are laid out on the controller makes up the user interface.  Other devices, such as digital cameras, audio mixing consoles, and stereo systems also have a user interface.\nWhile user interfaces can be designed for either hardware of software, most are a combination of both.  For example, to control a software program, you typically need to use a keyboard and mouse, which each have their own user interface.  Likewise, to control a digital camera, you may need to navigate through the on-screen menus, which is a software interface.  Regardless of the application, the goal of a good user interface is to be user-friendly.  After all, we all know how frustrating it can be to use a device that doesn't work the way we want it to."
