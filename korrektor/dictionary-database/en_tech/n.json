            "N-key rollover, or \"NKRO,\" is a feature of high-end keyboards that detects all keystrokes no matter how many keys are pressed simultaneously.  It ensures every keystroke is recorded and prevents \"ghosting,\" in which an extra keystroke may be registered when multiple keys are pressed together.\nIn a basic keyboard, the electrical connections from the base of the keys to the keyboard output (typically a USB connection) may intersect.  If you press multiple keys at the same time, the keyboard may register some keystrokes but not others.  Ghosting happens when the data from two or more keystrokes gets combined and registers input from a key you did not press.\nMost keyboards have some level of rollover, meaning they support multiple simultaneous keystrokes.  For example, an inexpensive keyboard might have 5-key rollover, while another might have 8-key rollover.  This type of rollover is also called \"x-key rollover,\" where x equals the number of keys that can be pressed and recorded simultaneously.\nN-key rollover means there is no limit to how many keys can be pressed and recorded at once.  This feature is typically found in high-end keyboards, such as gaming keyboards used in eSports.  Gamers often press several keys at once while playing video games, so it is essential for the keyboard to register all the input accurately.\nNOTE: The USB interface initially only supported 6 simultaneous keystrokes plus 4 modifier keys.  Modern USB interfaces do not have a simultaneous keystroke limit."

            "NAND is the most common type of flash memory.  It is used in several types of storage devices, including SSDs, USB flash drives, and SD cards.  NAND memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains stored data even when the power is turned off.\nWhat does NAND stand for?\nSurprisingly, NAND is not an acronym.  Instead, the term is short for \"NOT AND,\" a boolean operator and logic gate.  The NAND operator produces a FALSE value only if both values of its two inputs are TRUE.  It may be contrasted with the NOR operator, which only produces a TRUE value if both inputs are FALSE.\nNAND vs NOR Flash Memory\nNAND flash memory contains an integrated circuit that uses NAND gates to store data in memory cells.  NOR flash memory stores data using NOR gates.  While NOR devices read data faster, they are slower at writing data and do not store data as efficiently.  NAND devices write and erase data faster and store significantly more data than NOR devices of the same physical size.\nOverall, NAND storage is more efficient than NOR, which is why NAND is the most popular type of flash memory.  As read and write speeds have improved, NAND devices have become faster than traditional hard drives.  Therefore, SSDs and integrated flash memory have replaced HDDs in most computers."

If the computer is connected to a network, it can share data on its connected hard drives with other systems on the network.  While this allows multiple computers to send data back and forth, it requires that each computer share its files individually.  Therefore, if a computer is turned off or disconnected from the network, its files will not be available to the other systems.\nBy using NAS, computers can store and access data using a centralized storage location.  Instead of each computer sharing its own files, the shared data is stored on a single NAS server.  This provides a simpler and more reliable way of sharing files on a network.  Once an NAS server connected to a network (typically via Ethernet), it can be configured to share files with multiple computers on the network.  It may allow access to all systems or may provide access to a limited number of authenticated machines.\nNAS servers typically contain multiple hard drives, providing a large amount of shared disk space for connected systems to save data.  They are often used in business networks, but have become increasing more common in home networks as well.  Since NAS uses a centralized storage device, it can be a simple way for family members to share and backup their data."

This address is often used by the router that connects the computers to the Internet.  The router can be connected to a DSL modem, cable modem, T1 line, or even a dial-up modem.  When other computers on the Internet attempt to access computers within the local network, they only see the IP address of the router.  This adds an extra level of security, since the router can be configured as a firewall, only allowing authorized systems to access the computers within the network.\nOnce a system from outside the network has been allowed to access a computer within the network, the IP address is then translated from the router's address to the computer's unique address.  The address is found in a \"NAT table\" that defines the internal IP addresses of computers on the network.  The NAT table also defines the global address seen by computers outside the network.  Even though each computer within the local network has a specific IP address, external systems can only see one IP address when connecting to any of the computers within the network.\nTo simplify, network address translation makes computers outside the local area network (LAN) see only one IP address, while computers within the network can see each system's unique address.  While this aids in network security, it also limits the number of IP addresses needed by companies and organizations.  Using NAT, even large companies with thousands of computers can use a single IP address for connecting to the Internet.  Now that's efficient."

However, an antenna may be used to extended the range up to 20 centimeters.  This short range is intentional, as it provides security by only allowing devices to communicate within close proximity of each other.  This makes NFC ideal for secure transactions, such as contactless payments at a checkout counter.\nIf your smartphone or smartwatch supports NFC, you can enable a contactless payment option such as Apple Pay or Android Pay.  After linking a credit card to your device, you can make payments by simply holding your device near an NFC-enabled payment machine.\nThere are many other uses for NFC as well.  Examples include:\n\nPaying a fare on public transit, such as a bus or train\nConfirming your ticket at a concert or sports event\nSyncing workout data from a fitness machine with your device\nViewing special offers on your phone when you enter a store\nLoading information about an artist or piece of art at a museum\nViewing a map and related information at a national park\nLoading a translated menu at a restaurant\nChecking in and checking out at a hotel\nUnlocking an NFC-enabled door lock\n\nNFC is often seen as an alternative to QR codes, which require scanning a square code with your device.  Both technologies are designed for short-range transactions, but QR code scanning requires a camera, while NFC communication requires a near-field communication chip.  NFC communication is arguably simpler since you don't need to manually scan anything with your device.  Additionally, NFC provides two-way communication, while scanning a QR code is a one-way transaction.\nNOTE: Since the range of NFC is limited to only a few centimeters, it is ideal for quick data transfers and transactions.

The client can traverse subdirectories, look up file permissions, and read, write, and create files.  NFS translates the file paths and file commands to work with the corresponding file system.\nNOTE: NFS is an open standard, meaning any developer can add Network File System support to an application.

Anyone can create an NFT, but most are produced and sold by celebrities or known artists.  When you buy an NFT, you receive official ownership rights to the asset.\nWhile digital media can be easily copied, the value of an NFT is its ownership rights.  NFT licenses are stored in a blockchain, similar to a Bitcoin transaction record.  When someone purchases an NFT, the transaction is recorded in the blockchain, and that person acquires exclusive rights to the asset.\nAre NFTs Unique?\nEach NFT is unique, but creators may offer multiple \"editions\" of an NFT.  For example, an artist may sell five editions of the same digital painting, which five different people can purchase.  A sports figure may offer several hundred or even several thousand editions of a digital sports card.

It may enable a wired connection (such as Ethernet) or a wireless connection (such as Wi-Fi) to a local area network.\nNICs were commonly included in desktop computers in the 1990s and early 2000s.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, many computers did not include networking capabilities, so a NIC could be added as an expansion card.  Most NICs were installed in a PCI slot on the motherboard.  Early NICs included a BNC connector for coax network connections, though Ethernet ports soon became the standard.  Therefore most NICs include one or more Ethernet ports.\nAs wireless networking became more popular, wireless NICs also grew in popularity.  Instead of an Ethernet port, wireless NICs are designed for Wi-Fi connections and often have an antenna to provide better wireless reception for the computer.  Older wireless cards have PCI connections while most modern wireless NICs connect to a PCI Express slot.\nSince many different networking standards exist, it is best to match the specifications of a NIC to the standard of network.  For example, if you are connecting to a Gigabit Ethernet network, a Gigabit Ethernet NIC is the best choice.  A 100Base-T card will work, but you will only get 1\/10 of the possible data transfer rate.  A 10 Gigabit Ethernet Card may also work, but you will only experience gigabit speeds on the network.  Wireless cards also use the lowest common denominator between the network and the NIC.  However, if a wireless card does not support a newer wireless standard (such as 802.11ac), it may not be able to connect to the network.\nNIC vs Network Adapter\nTechnically, a NIC is a physical card that connects to an expansion slot in a computer.  Many computers and wireless devices now include an integrated networking component called a network adapter.  This may be an Ethernet controller and port attached to the edge of a motherboard or a small wireless networking chip located on the motherboard.  A network adapter may also be a small peripheral that connects to a USB port.  While the terms \"NIC\" and \"network adapter\" are often used synonymously, a NIC is a type of network adapter while a network adapter is not necessarily a NIC.\n"

This includes the overall performance of the network as well as individual devices and connections.  For example, the NMS may detect aspects of a network where throughput is nearing the maximum bandwidth available.  The data can be used to optimize the flow of traffic and recommend the addition of new hardware if needed.\nDevice management An NMS can provide a simple way to manage multiple devices from a central location.  It may be used to configure a device or modify settings based on the performance analysis.  Examples include activating specific network ports on a switch or implemeting bandwidth throttling for certain devices.\nFault management - If a device or section of a network fails, an NMS may be able to automatically reroute traffic to limit downtime.

When a fault occurs, a network alert or notification is usually sent to one or more network administrators.\n\nWhy use an NMS?\nIn small networks, such as a residential or home network, an NMS is not necessary.  However, it is important for any large network, such as those found in enterprise configurations.  Server farms, data centers, and corporate networks may have hundreds or thousands of connected devices.  It is important to have a central network monitoring system in place to manage the devices.

NNTP servers, for example, can communicate with each other and replicate newsgroups among each other.  This is how the Usenet network is created and maintained.  In the client-server model, NNTP allows a client system to connect to a Usenet server and provides commands for browsing and viewing articles on the server.\nUsenet was originally based on UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy), an early protocol used for file transfers between Unix systems.  The only way to read articles via UUCP was to log into a Usenet server and read articles directly from the local disk.  NNTP made it possible to access a Usenet server remotely from a client system running newsreader software.\nExamples of commands supported by the Network News Transfer Protocol include:\n\nARTICLE - retrieve an article from a Usenet server\nGROUP - select a specific newsgroup\nIHAVE - tell the server the client has an article it may want\nLIST - retrieve a list of newsgroups available on the server\nNEWSGROUPS - receive a list of newsgroups created after a specific date and time\nNEWNEWS - receive a list of articles created after a specific date and time\nNEXT - go to the next message in the newsgroup\nPOST - post a message or reply to an existing one\n\nIn most cases, these and other NNTP commands are handled automatically by newsreader software.

Since all networks have some amount of latency, the delay between the request and the response must be taken into account.  NTP uses the client-server model and calculates the round-trip delay using four values:\n\nclient request timestamp\nserver reception timestamp\nserver response timestamp\nclient reception timestamp\n\nThe time between 1 and 2 above is added to the time between 3 and 4 to compute the total round-trip delay.  By subtracting half of this delay, it is possible to estimate the exact time on a remote server, usually within a few milliseconds.\nSince network conditions can affect the time it takes to transmit or receive NTP packets, a single request may not produce an accurate result.  Therefore, it is common to make several NTP requests and average the latency to produce a more accurate timestamp.  Timestamps may also be averaged across multiple computers to produce a consistent time for all machines on a network.   When syncing multiple clocks at once, NTP is used as a peer-to-peer protocol, in which each system is a time source.\nNTP Examples\nThe network time protocol is used by several different time-syncing utilities, including tools built into Windows and macOS.

The following mathematical calculations produce NaN because the result is undefined:\n\n0 \u00f7 0\n0 x \u221e\n\u221e \u00f7 \u221e\n\nWhen a calculation involves a character, string, or other non-numeric value, the result may also be NaN.  For example, 20 x \"horse\" does not produce a numeric result since 20 is an integer and \"horse\" is a string.  A function may return NaN as a result of invalid input, which is a preferred alternative to a program crash.\nSome spreadsheet and database programs display NaN or #NaN in a table cell when the cell formula has not received valid numeric input for the calculation.\nDifferent programming languages handle NaN values in different ways.  For example, in JavaScript, NaN is a property of a global object (i.e. Number.NaN).  JavaScript provides an isNan() function to check if a value is NaN.  PHP uses the function is_nan() for the same purpose.  Both return a boolean value of true or false."

There are several different types of namespaces, and each one has a specific syntax used to define  the corresponding elements.  Each element within a namespace has a \"local name\" that serves as a unique identifier.\nNamespaces are used in many areas of computing, such as domain names, file paths, and XML documents.  Below are examples of these different applications.\n\nDomain Names - The namespace syntax for domain names is specified by the Domain Name System, or DNS.  It includes the top-level domain, (e.g. \"techterms.com\") and a subdomain, such as \"www.\"  In the URL \"www.techterms.com,\" the namespace identifier is \"techterms.com,\" while the local name is \"www.\"\nFile Paths - File locations may be specified using a file path, which can include multiple directories.  A file path, which uses syntax defined by the operating system, is considered a namespace.  For example, C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer is the namespace that describes where Internet Explorer files on a Windows computer.  The namespace \/usr\/local\/apache\/ defines the location of Apache files on a Unix-based web server.  Individual filenames within these directories serve as unique identifiers.\nXML Documents - XML namespaces (XMLNS) are used to associate a document's element and attribute names with a namespace identified by an external URI.  For example, an XML file may include HTML elements that are specified at \"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml.\"  This reference might appear as \"&lt;html:html xmlns:html='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml'&gt;\" near the top of the XML document.\n\nThe above examples are just a few types of namespaces used in computing.  They are also used to define network devices and other types of computer hardware.  Additionally, computer programmers often used namespaces to group related variables within the source code of a program.  While there are many different types of namespaces, they all serve the same purpose \u2014 to contain a logical grouping of related elements."

One nanometer is one billionth of a meter, so nanometers are certainly not used to measure long distances.  Instead, they serve to measure extremely small objects, such as atomic structures or transistors found in modern CPUs.\nA single nanometer is one million times smaller than a millimeter.  If you take one thousandth of a millimeter, you have one micrometer, or a single micron.  If you divide that micron by 1,000, you have a nanometer.  Needless to say, a nanometer is extremely small.\nSince integrated circuits, such as computer processors, contain microscopic components, nanometers are useful for measuring their size.  In fact, different eras of processors are defined in nanometers, in which the number defines the distance between transistors and other components within the CPU.  The smaller the number, the more transistors that can be placed within the same area, allowing for faster, more efficient processor designs.\nIntel's processor line, for example, has included chips based on the 90-nanometer, 65-nanometer, 45-nanometer, and 32-nanometer processes.  In 2011, Intel released chips that were created using a 22-nanometer process.  Intel's \"Broadwell\" design, introduced in 2014, uses a 14-nanometer process.  \nAbbreviation: nm"

This is a native Word file -- that is, the file format is native to the Microsoft Word application and may not be recognized by other programs.\nWhen you use the \"Save As...\" command to save a file, you may be given the option to save the file in a different format.  For example, you might be able to save a Word document as a plain text (.txt) file or a rich text (.rtf) file.  These formats are not native to Microsoft Word, but can still be opened by the Microsoft Word program.  Similarly, Adobe Photoshop saves files as Photoshop documents (.psd files), but can also save them in .jpg and .gif formats, among others.\nIt is usually best to save a file in a program's native file format because you can be sure it will store all the data you have created with the program.  While other formats may be more compatible with other programs, they might not save all the information in the file.  For example, if you save a Word document as a plain text file, all the text formatting you had added will be removed.  Saving a Photoshop document in JPEG format will reduce the image quality and flatten all the image's layers.\nSo if you're planning on editing a file after you've saved it, saving it as a native file is the best choice.

While some users may feel like they can hide behind their keyboard or smartphone when posting online, the fact is they are still the ones publishing the content.

In practical applications, such as database and spreadsheet programs, null characters are used as fillers for spaces."

            "Num Lock is a key that is typically located near the keypad on the right side of a keyboard.  Like Caps Lock, Num Lock is a toggle key, which toggles the input of certain keys, depending whether Num Lock is on or off.\nNum Lock is short for \"Number Lock.\"  It was implemented in early Windows keyboards to lock the input of the numeric keypad.  When Num Lock is on, the keypad only enters numbers.  When Num Lock is off, the keys may provide different input as indicated below:\n\n. - Delete\n0 - Insert\n1 - End\n2 - Down Arrow\n3 - Page Down\n4 - Left Arrow\n5 - Clear\n6 - Right Arrow\n7 - Home\n8 - Up Arrow\n9 - Page Up\n\nSince early PC keyboards did not have arrow keys, Num Lock gave the keypad a useful dual functionality.  However, now that most keyboards have arrow keys and other special keys, such as Page Up and Page down, the Num Lock key is not often used.  On some keyboards (especially Macintosh keyboards), the Num Lock is not functional.  On others, it typically is set to ON by default.\nWhile you may not need to use the Num Lock key with your keyboard, it is helpful to know the key's function.  If you find yourself trying to enter numbers with the numeric keypad and nothing appears on the screen, it is possible that Num Lock is OFF.  If this is the case, pressing the Num Lock key should fix the problem."

            "A nybble, sometimes spelled \"nibble,\" is a set of four bits.  Since there are eight bits in a byte, a nybble is half of one byte.  While it may take the average person several nibbles to equal one bite of a cookie, in the computer world, two nybbles always equal one byte.\nThe four bits in a nibble allow it to have 16 possible values, which is the same as one hexadecimal digit.  Therefore, a nybble is sometimes referred to as a \"hex digit.\"  In data communications, nybbles are sometimes called \"quadbits,\" because of the four bits that make up each nybble."
