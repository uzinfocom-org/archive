            "Stands for \"Digital-to-Analog Converter\" and is often pronounced \"dac.\"  Since computers only recognize digital information, the output produced by computers is typically in digital format.  However, some output devices only accept analog input, which means a digital-to-analog converter, or DAC, must be used.\nThe most common use for a DAC is to convert digital audio to an analog signal.  This conversion typically takes place in the sound card, which has a built-in DAC.  The digital signal, which is basically a stream of ones and zeros, is transformed into an analog signal that might take the form of an electrical charge.  This electrical charge is recognized by most speaker inputs and therefore can be output to a speaker system.\nDACs are also used for converting video signals.  Historically, most video displays, such as TVs and computer monitors used analog inputs.  Only in the last couple of years have digital displays with DVI and HDMI connections become commonplace.  Therefore, in order for a computer to output to an analog display, the digital video signal must be converted to an analog signal.  This is why all video cards with an analog output (such as a VGA connection) also include a DAC.\nAny time a signal is converted from one format to another, there is a potential loss of quality.  Therefore, it is important to have a high-quality DAC whether you are converting audio or video signals.  The same holds true when performing the opposite conversion, which requires an analog-to-digital converter, or ADC."

While DAS is still the most common type of storage used in personal computing, network and server administrators often need to choose between DAS and NAS for a storage solution.\nThe primary benefit of DAS vs NAS is the simplicity of the setup.  You can simply connect a device to a computer and, as long as the necessary drivers are available, it will show up as an additional storage device.  There is no need to configure network settings or set up permissions for individual computers.  The main drawback of DAS is that a direct-attached device is only accessible via the computer to which it is attached.  Therefore, a computer must be configured as a file server in order for other systems to access any connected DAS devices."

This file system was originally established in December 1998 and has since become the standard file system used by all digital cameras.  Therefore, whenever you connect a digital camera or smartphone to your PC, your computer will look for the DCIM folder.  Similarly, if you insert a memory card into a card reader connected to your computer, it will scan the memory card for a folder named \"DCIM.\"\nThe DCIM folder provides a standard way for computers to recognize and import images from connected devices.

Advantages include faster data transfer rates and larger capacities, thanks to greater memory density and more memory banks (16 rather than 8).

However, computers access Internet devices by their IP addresses.  DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing you to access an Internet location by its domain name.\nThanks to DNS, you can visit a website by typing in the domain name rather than the IP address.  For example, to visit the Tech Terms Computer Dictionary, you can simply type \"techterms.com\" in the address bar of your web browser rather than the IP address (67.43.14.98).  It also simplifies email addresses, since DNS translates the domain name (following the \"@\" symbol) to the appropriate IP address.\nTo understand how DNS works, you can think of it like the contacts app on your smartphone.  When you call a friend, you simply select his or her name from a list.  The phone does not actually call the person by name, it calls the person's phone number.  DNS works the same way by associating a unique IP address with each domain name.\nUnlike your address book, the DNS translation table is not stored in a single location.  Instead, the data is stored on millions of servers around the world.  When a domain name is registered, it must be assigned at least two nameservers (which can be edited through the domain name registrar at any time).  The nameserver addresses point to a server that has a directory of domain names and their associated IP addresses.  When a computer accesses a website over the Internet, it locates the corresponding nameserver and gets the correct IP address for the website.\nSince DNS translation creates additional overhead when connecting to websites, ISPs cache DNS records and host the data locally.  Once the IP address of a domain name is cached, an ISP can automatically direct subsequent requests to the appropriate IP address.  This works great until an IP address changes, in which case the request may be sent to the wrong server or the server will not respond at all.  Therefore, DNS caches are updated regularly, usually somewhere between a few hours and a few days. "

For example, when a host requests an IP address from a name server using a standard DNS query, it assumes the name server is valid.  However, a name server can pretend to be another server by spoofing (or faking) its IP address.  A fake name server could potentially redirect domain names to the wrong websites.\nDNSSEC provides extra security by requiring authentication with a digital signature.  Each query and response is \"signed\" using a public\/private key pair.  The private key is generated by the host and the public key is generated by a DNS zone, or group of trusted servers.  These servers create a chain of trust, in which they validate each other's public keys.  Each DNSSEC-enabled name server stores its public key in a hashed \"DNSKEY\" DNS record.\nEnabling DNSSEC\nWhile DNSSEC is not required for web servers or mail servers, many web hosts recommend it.  To configure DNSSEC, you must use a nameserver that supports it, like PowerDNS or Knot DNS.  Then you must enable DNSSEC on your server and configure it within the control panel interface.\nIf you are using a public nameserver, activating DNSSEC up may be as simple as clicking \"Enable DNSSEC.\"  If you are using a custom name server, you may need to manually create one or more delegation signer (DS) records.  After you have enabled DNSSEC, it may take several hours to activate since the server must validate the DS records with other servers within the DNS zone."

By typing simple instructions such as pwd (print working directory) and cd (change directory), the user can browse the files on the hard drive, open files, and run programs.  While the commands are simple to type, the user must know the basic commands in order to use DOS effectively (similar to Unix).  This made the operating system difficult for novices to use, which is why Microsoft later bundled the graphic-based Windows operating system with DOS.\nThe first versions of Windows (through Windows 95) actually ran on top of the DOS operating system.  This is why so many DOS-related files (such as .INI, .DLL, and .COM files) are still used by Windows.  However, the Windows operating system was rewritten for Windows NT (New Technology), which enabled Windows to run on its own, without using DOS.  Later versions of Windows, such as Windows 2000, XP, and Vista, also do not require DOS.\nDOS is still included with Windows, but is run from the Windows operating system instead of the other way around.  The DOS command prompt can be opened in Windows by selecting \"Run...\" from the Start Menu and typing cmd."

Since a 600 dpi printer can print 600 dots both horizontally and vertically per inch, it actually prints 360,000 (600 x 600) dots per square inch.\nAlso, since most monitors have a native resolution of 72 or 96 pixels per inch, they cannot display a 300 dpi image in actual size.  Instead, when viewed at 100%, the image will look much larger than the print version because the pixels on the screen take up more space than the dots on the paper."

This is an efficient way to store data in memory, because it requires less physical space to store the same amount of data than if it was stored statically.  Therefore, a DRAM chip can hold more data than an SRAM (static RAM) chip of the same size can.  However, the capacitors in DRAM need to constantly be refreshed to keep their charge, so DRAM requires more power than SRAM.\nStill, because DRAM can hold more data than SRAM and because it is significantly less expensive to manufacture, DRAM is the most common type of memory found in personal computer systems.  While there are many types of DRAM available, the most common type is synchronous DRAM SDRAM, which is a faster version of standard DRAM.  This is the type of memory most computers use for their main system memory.\nIf you choose to upgrade your computer's SDRAM, check your machine's requirements to see if the memory modules must be installed in pairs.  If so, you will need to replace two modules at once and they must be the same size (i.e. two 1GB SDRAM memory modules)."

Each audio file downloaded from the iTunes music store includes information about the owner of the file and how many times the file has been transferred.  The protected files will not play on computers that have not been authorized to play the music.\nDigital Rights Management is important to publishers of electronic media since it helps ensure they will receive the appropriate revenue for their products.  By controlling the trading, protection, monitoring, and tracking of digital media, DRM helps publishers limit the illegal propagation of copyrighted works.  This can be accomplished by using digital watermarks or proprietary file encryption on the media they distribute.  Whatever method publishers choose to employ, DRM helps them make sure that their digital content is only used by those who have paid for it."

            "Stands for \"Digital Subscriber Line.\"  DSL is a communications medium used to transfer digital signals over standard telephone lines.  Along with cable Internet, DSL is one of the most popular ways ISPs provide broadband Internet access.\nWhen you make a telephone call using a landline, the voice signal is transmitted using low frequencies from 0 Hz to 4 kHz.  This range, called the \"voiceband,\" only uses a small part of the frequency range supported by copper phone lines.  Therefore, DSL makes use of the higher frequencies to transmit digital signals, in the range of 25 kHz to 1.5 MHz.  While these frequencies are higher than the highest audible frequency (20 kHz), they can still cause interference during phone conversations.  Therefore, DSL filters or splitters are used to make sure the high frequencies do not interfere with phone calls.\nSymmetric DSL (SDSL) splits the upstream and downstream frequencies evenly, providing equal speeds for both sending and receiving data.  However, since most users download more data than they upload, ISPs typically offer asymmetric DSL (ADSL) service.  ADSL provides a wider frequency range for downstream transfers, which offers several times faster downstream speeds.  For example, an SDSL connection may provide 2 Mbps upstream and downstream, while an ASDL connection may offer 20 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream.\nIn order to access the Internet using DSL, you must connect to a DSL Internet service provider (ISP).  The ISP will provide you with a DSL modem, which you can connect to either a router or a computer.  Some DSL modems now have built-in wireless routers, which allows you to connect to your DSL modem via Wi-Fi.  A DSL kit may also include a splitter and filters that you can connect to landline phones.\nNOTE: Since DSL signals have a limited range, you must live within a specific distance of an ISP in order to be eligible for DSL Internet service.  While most urban locations now have access to DSL, it is not available in many rural areas."

Some DVDs are formatted specifically for video playback, while others may contain different types of data, such as software programs and computer files.\nThe original \"DVD-Video\" format was standardized in 1995 by a consortium of electronics companies, including Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, and Philips.  It provided a number of improvements over analog VHS tapes, including higher quality video, widescreen aspect ratios, custom menus, and chapter markers, which allow you to jump to different sections within a video.  DVDs can also be watched repeatedly without reducing the quality of the video and of course, they don't need to be rewound.  A standard video DVD can store 4.7 GB of data, which is enough to hold over 2 hours of video in 720p resolution, using MPEG-2 compression.\nDVDs are also used to distribute software programs.  Since some applications and other software (such as clip art collections) are too large to fit on a single 700 MB CD, DVDs provide a way to distribute large programs on a single disc.  Writable DVDs also provide a way to store a large number of files and back up data.  The writable DVD formats include DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM.  While the different writable DVD formats caused a lot of confusion and incompatibility issues in the early 2000s, most DVD drives now support all formats besides DVD-RAM.\nA standard DVD can hold 4.7 GB of data, but variations of the original DVD format have greater capacities.  For example, a dual-layer DVD (which has two layers of data on a single side of the disc) can store 8.5 GB of data.  A dual-sided DVD can store 9.4 GB of data (4.7 x 2).  A dual-layer, dual-sided DVD can store 17.1 GB of data.  The larger capacity formats are not supported by most standalone DVD players, but they can be used with many computer-based DVD drives."

Some notable applications include 1) data design, 2) data storage, and 3) data security.\n1. Data design, or data architecture, refers to the way data is structured.  For example, when creating a file format for an application, the developer must decide how to organize the data in the file.  For some applications, it may make sense to store data in a text format, while other programs may benefit from a binary file format.  Regardless of what format the developer uses, the data must be organized within the file in a structure that can be recognized by the associated program.\n2. Data storage refers to the many different ways of storing data.  This includes hard drives, flash memory, optical media, and temporary RAM storage.  When selecting an appropriate data storage medium, concepts such as data access and data integrity are important to consider.  For example, data that is accessed and modified on a regular basis should be stored on a hard drive or flash media.  This is because these types of media provide quick access and allow the data to be moved or changed.  Archived data, on the other hand, may be stored on optical media, such as CDs and DVDs, since the data does not need to be changed.  Optical discs also maintain data integrity longer than hard drives, which makes them a good choice for archival purposes.\n3. Data security involves protecting computer data.  Many individuals and businesses store valuable data on computer systems.  If you've ever felt like your life is stored on your computer, you understand how important data can be.  Therefore, it is wise to take steps to protect the privacy and integrity of your data.  Some steps include installing a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to your computer and encrypting personal data that is submitted online or shared with other users.  It is also important to backup your data so that you will be able to recover your files in case your primary storage device fails."

            "Data mining is the process of analyzing large amounts of data in order to discover patterns and other information.  It is typically performed on databases, which store data in a structured format.  By \"mining\" large amounts of data, hidden information can be discovered and used for other purposes.\nData Mining Examples\nA credit card company might use data mining to learn more about their members' buying habits.  By analyzing purchases from cardholders across the United States, the company may discover shopping habits for different demographics, such as age, race, and location.  This information could be useful in offering individuals specific promotions.  The same data may also reveal shopping patterns in different regions of the country.  This information could be valuable to companies looking to advertise or start businesses in specific states.\nOnline services, such as Google and Facebook, mine enormous amounts of data to provide targeted content and advertisements to their users.  Google, for example, might analyze search queries to discover popular searches for certain areas and move those to the top of the autocomplete list (the suggestions that appear as you type).  By mining user activity data, Facebook might discover popular topics among different age groups and provide targeted ads based on this information.\nWhile data mining is commonly used for marketing purposes, it has many other uses as well.  For instance, healthcare companies may use data mining to discover links between certain genes and diseases.  Weather companies can mine data to discover weather patterns that may help predict future meteorologic events.  Traffic management institutions can mine automotive data to forecast future traffic levels and create appropriate plans for highways and streets.\nData Mining Requirements\nData mining requires two things \u2014 lots of data and lots of computing power.  The more organized the data, the easier it is to mine it for useful information.  Therefore it is important for any organization that wants to engage in data mining to be proactive in selecting what data to log and how to store it.  When it comes to mining the data, supercomputers and computing clusters may be used to process petabytes of data."

The goal of data science is to gain insights and knowledge from any type of data \u2014 both structured and unstructured.\nData science is related to computer science, but is a separate field.   Computer science involves creating programs and algorithms to record and process data, while data science covers any type of data analysis, which may or may not use computers.  Data science is more closely related to the mathematics field of Statistics, which includes the collection, organization, analysis, and presentation of data.\nBecause of the large amounts of data modern companies and organizations maintain, data science has become an integral part of IT.  For example, a company that has petabytes of user data may use data science to develop effective ways to store, manage, and analyze the data.  The company may use the scientific method to run tests and extract results that can provide meaningful insights about their users.\nData Science vs Data Mining\nData science is often confused with data mining.  However, data mining is a subset of data science.  It involves analyzing large amounts of data (such as big data) in order to discover patterns and other useful information.  Data science covers the entire scope of data collection and processing."

Therefore, a better definition of a data type is a data storage format that can contain a specific type or range of values.\nWhen computer programs store data in variables, each variable must be assigned a specific data type.  Some common data types include integers, floating point numbers, characters, strings, and arrays.  They may also be more specific types, such as dates, timestamps, boolean values, and varchar (variable character) formats.\nSome programming languages require the programmer to define the data type of a variable before assigning it a value.  Other languages can automatically assign a variable's data type when the initial data is entered into the variable.  For example, if the variable \"var1\" is created with the value \"1.25,\" the variable would be created as a floating point data type.  If the variable is set to \"Hello world!,\" the variable would be assigned a string data type.  Most programming languages allow each variable to store a single data type.  Therefore, if the variable's data type has already been set to an integer, assigning string data to the variable may cause the data to be converted to an integer format.\nData types are also used by database applications.  The fields within a database often require a specific type of data to be input.  For example, a company's record for an employee may use a string data type for the employee's first and last name.  The employee's date of hire would be stored in a date format, while his or her salary may be stored as an integer.  By keeping the data types uniform across multiple records, database applications can easily search, sort, and compare fields in different records."

This makes datagrams ideal for streaming services, where the constant flow of data is more important than 100% accuracy.\nDatagrams are also called \"IP datagrams\" since they are used by the Internet protocol (IP).  This protocol defines how information is sent between systems over the Internet.  For example, each device connected to the Internet must have an IP address, which serves as a unique identifier.  Whenever data is transmitted via the Internet protocol, it is broken up into packets or datagrams, which each contain a header plus the actual data transmitted.\nA datagram header defines the source and destination of the data as well as other information, such as the total length (or size) of the datagram, time to live (TTL), and the specific protocol used to transfer the data.

When an active application hits a deadlock, it may \"hang\" or become unresponsive.\nResources, such as saved or cached data, may be locked when accessed by a specific process within a program.  Locking the data prevents other processes from overwriting the data prematurely.  If a process or query needs to access locked data, but the process locking the data won't let it go, a deadlock may occur.\nFor example, the following situation will cause a deadlock between two processes:\n\nProcess 1 requests resource B from process 2.\nResource B is locked while process 2 is running.\nProcess 2 requires resource A from process 1 to finish running.\nResource A is locked while process 1 is running.\n\nThe result is that process 1 and process 2 are waiting for each other to finish.  Since neither process can continue until the other one completes, a deadlock is created.\nAvoiding Deadlocks\nDevelopers can prevent deadlocks by avoiding locking conditions in their programming logic.  For example, instead of having two processes rely on each other, the source code can be written so that each thread finishes before another thread needs its resources.  By ensuring data is accessible when needed, programmers can protect their applications from hanging or crashing.\nNOTE: Deadlocks may also occur when two or more queries are run on a database.  Transactional databases lock active records, preventing other queries from accessing them.  If a process cannot access a locked record, a database deadlock may occur.\n"

So how is it possible to view encrypted data?  The answer is decryption.\nHow Decryption Works\nThere are several ways to encrypt files, but most methods involve one or more \"keys.\"  When encrypting a file, the key may be a single password.  Network encryption often involves a public key and a private key shared between each end of the data transfer.\nDecryption works by applying the opposite conversion algorithm used to encrypt the data.  The same key is required to return the encrypted data to its original state.  For example, if the password \"ABC123\" is used to encrypt a file, the same password is needed to decrypt the file.\nSecure network transfers, including Internet connections, handle encryption and decryption in the background.  Protocols such as HTTPS and Secure SMTP encrypt and decrypt data on the fly.  These protocols automatically generate a secure key for each encrypted network transfer and do not require a password.\nNOTE: Encrypting data is a smart way to protect private information from prying eyes.

This includes standard components such as the CPU, RAM, storage device, and video card.  Retail stores typically carry default hardware configurations, while online stores are more likely to offer customization options.\nIn software, \"default\" describes preset settings.  For example, when you install a program for the first time, it will load the default preferences.  If you want to change these settings, you can open the \"Preferences\" window and modify the default options to suit your needs.

For example, your computer may have over a dozen applications that can open .JPG files.  Therefore, the operating system needs to know which program to open by default when you double-click a JPEG image file.\nBoth Windows and Macintosh computers store a list of default programs for each file extension.  These relationships between programs and file extensions are also called \"file associations.\"  Both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems allow you to change file associations if you don't like the default program that is associated with a certain file type.  For example, if you prefer to play MP3 files in iTunes rather than Windows Media Player, you can change the \".mp3\" file association to iTunes.

Therefore, CRT monitors often include a \"Degauss\" command that resets the magnetic field when run.

A hard drive degausser, for example, includes a chamber where you can insert a hard drive.  When you run the degausser, it uses a process called capacitative discharge to decrease the drive's magnetic field, making any data on the drive unreadable.  The cycle time, which is the time it takes for the data to be erased, varies between degaussers, but is usually between ten seconds and one minute.

Denary is often contrasted with binary, the standard number system used by computers and other electronic devices.\nThe first two letters in denary (\"de\") are an abbreviated version of \"dec\" which is a Latin prefix meaning \"ten.\"  The Latin prefix \"bi\" means two.  Therefore, the denary system contains ten digits, while the binary system only contains two (0 and 1).  Both systems can be used to represent any integer.

Since most servers have firewalls and other security software installed, it is easy to lock out individual systems.  Therefore, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are often used to coordinate multiple systems in a simultaneous attack.\nA distributed denial of service attack tells all coordinated systems to send a stream of requests to a specific server at the same time.  These requests may be a simple ping or a more complex series of packets.  If the server cannot respond to the large number of simultaneous requests, incoming requests will eventually become queued.  This backlog of requests may result in a slow response time or a no response at all.  When the server is unable to respond to legitimate requests, the denial of service attack has succeeded.\nDoS attacks are a common method hackers use to attack websites.  Since flooding a server with requests does not require any authentication, even a highly secured server is vulnerable.  However, a single system is typically not capable of carrying out a successful DoS attack.  Therefore, a hacker may create a botnet to control multiple computers at once.  A botnet can be used to carry out a DDoS attack, which is far more effective than an attack from a single computer.\nDenial of service attacks can be problematic, especially when they cause large websites to be unavailable during high-traffic times.  Fortunately, security software has been developed to detect DoS attacks and limit their effectiveness.  While many well-known websites, like Google, Twitter, and WordPress, have all been targets of denial of service attacks in the past, they have been able to update their security systems and prevent further service interruptions.

For example, in PHP, the ereg() function, which is used to search for matching strings was deprecated in favor of the preg_match() function, which is faster and more flexible.  While the ereg() function may work with current PHP installations, it may not be supported in future versions of PHP.  Therefore, developers are discouraged to rely on the ereg() function and are encouraged to updated their source code to use to preg_match() function instead.\nIn HTML, elements such as tags and attributes may be deprecated from one version to the next.  For example, in HTML 5, several common tags used in HTML 4 have been deprecated.  These include &lt;center&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;, and several others.  While modern browsers may still interpret these tags correctly, they are not guaranteed to work, and therefore should be avoided.\nThe process of deprecating functions and elements in a programming language is called \"deprecation.\"  Typically, this process lasts for several versions of the language, which gives developers ample time to update their code.  Most software development environments (IDEs) also alert programmers when deprecated items are being used.  These warnings help developers remove deprecated items before they cause syntax errors or other problems in a program."

            "Design patterns are reusable solutions for software development.  They serve as templates that programmers can use when creating applications.  They are not specific to individual programming languages, but instead are best practices or heuristics that can be applied in different programming environments.\nWhile design patterns are not language-dependent, they often include objects or classes.  Therefore, they are typically associated with object-oriented programming.  Individual patterns can be classified into three different categories: 1) creational patterns, 2) structural patterns, and 3) behavioral patterns.\n1. Creational Patterns\nCreational design patterns describe ways to create objects using methods that are appropriate for different situations.  For example, the \"Singleton\" pattern is used to create a basic class that will only have one instance.  A common example is a global variable defined in the source code of a program.  An \"Object Pool\" pattern is used to create a class with a \"pool\" of objects that can be retrieved as needed instead of being recreated.  This is often used for caching purposes.\n2. Structural Patterns\nStructural design patterns define the relationships between objects.  For example, the \"Private Class Data\" pattern is used to limit access to a specific class.  This can prevent unwanted modification of an object.  The \"Decorator\" class, on the other hand, allows behaviors and states to be added to an object at runtime.  This provides programmers with the flexibility to add as many classes to an object as needed.  One example is an avatar in a video game that accumulates weapons, armor, and items throughout the game.  The appropriately named \"Decorator\" class would provide a good framework for this process.\n3. Behavioral Patterns\nBehavioral design patterns describe the behavior of objects, such as the way they communicate with each other.  One example is the \"Command\" pattern, which describes objects that execute commands.  The \"Memento\" pattern records the state of an object so it can be restored to its saved stated.  These two patterns can be used together to perform Undo and Redo operations in a program.\nSummary\nEach of the three categories include several other design patterns that programmers can use.  While the patterns provide helpful templates for software developers, they are sometimes criticized for being unnecessary or not specific enough for certain applications.  Therefore, while design patterns are useful tools for programming, they do not need to be followed exactly to create a well-designed software program."

It involves reading through the functions within the code and manually testing them, often with multiple input values.  Developers may desk check their code before releasing a software program to make sure the algorithms are functioning efficiently and correctly.\nThe term \"desk checking\" refers to the manual approach of reviewing source code (sitting a desk), rather than running it through a debugger or another automated process.  In some cases, a programmer may even use a pencil and paper to record the process and output of functions within a program.  For example, the developer may track the value of one or more variables in a function from beginning to end.  Manually going through the code line-by-line may help a programmer catch improper logic or inefficiencies that a software debugger would not.\nWhile desk checking is useful for uncovering logic errors and other issues within a program's source code, it is time-consuming and subject to human error.  Therefore, an IDE or debugging tool is better suited for detecting small problems, such as syntax errors.  It is also helpful to have more than one developer desk check a program to reduce the likelihood of overlooking errors in the source code."

Fortunately, computers with graphical user interfaces have enabled desktop publishing, which allows this process to be done electronically.\nAny time you use a computer to create a printable document, it can be considered desktop publishing.  However, the term is most commonly used to refer to professional computer-based publishing.  Desktop publishers use programs like Adobe InDesign and QuarkXpress to create page layouts for documents they want to print.  These desktop publishing programs can be used to create books, magazines, newspapers, flyers, pamphlets, and many other kinds of printed documents.  Publishers may also use programs like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create printable images.

Software developers often have more specific titles, such as programmer, software analyst, or software engineer.  A software programmer, for example, is someone who writes source code that can be run as a script or compiled into an executable program.  A software analyst provides the requirements and specifications for a software program and may also assist in programming the software.  A software engineer is the person who designs applications from the ground up and often oversees the development of software programs.\nWeb Developer\nA web developer is a person who builds and maintains websites.  Technically, he or she can perform more specialized web development tasks, such as coding HTML, writing CSS, and publishing content online.  Though web design is a subcategory of web development, web designers may also be called web developers since there is a lot of overlap between the two professions.

When a user initiates a dial-up connection, the modem dials a phone number of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that is designated to receive dial-up calls.  The ISP then establishes the connection, which usually takes about ten seconds and is accompanied by several beeping an buzzing sounds.\nAfter the dial-up connection has been established, it is active until the user disconnects from the ISP.  Typically, this is done by selecting the \"Disconnect\" option using the ISP's software or a modem utility program.  However, if a dial-up connection is interrupted by an incoming phone call or someone picking up a phone in the house, the service may also be disconnected.\nIn the early years of the Internet, especially in the 1990s, a dial-up connection was the standard way to connect to the Internet.  Companies like AOL, Prodigy, and Earthlink offered dial-up service across the U.S., while several smaller companies offered local dial-up Internet connections.  However, due to slow speeds (a maximum of 56 Kbps), and the hassle of constantly disconnecting and reconnecting to the ISP, dial-up service was eventually replaced by DSL and cable modem connections.  Both DSL and cable lines, known as \"broadband\" connections, offer speeds that are over 100 times faster than dial-up and provide an \"always on\" connection.  While we don't get to listen to the fun buzzing and beeping noises of older modems anymore, it certainly is nice to download data in a fraction of the time."

This method of computation, also known as the binary system, may seem rather simplistic, but can be used to represent incredible amounts of data.  CDs and DVDs can be used to store and play back high-quality sound and video even though they consist entirely of ones and zeros.\nUnlike computers, humans perceive information in analog.  We capture auditory and visual signals as a continuous stream.  Digital devices, on the other hand, estimate this information using ones and zeros.  The rate of this estimation, called the \"sampling rate,\" combined with how much information is included in each sample (the bit depth), determines how accurate the digital estimation is.\nFor example, a typical CD audio track is sampled at 44.1 KHz (44,100 samples per second) with a bit depth of 16 bits.  This provides a high-quality estimation of an analog audio signal that sounds realistic the human ear.  However, a higher-quality audio format, such as a DVD-Audio disc, may be sampled at 96 KHz and have a bit depth of 24 bits.  The same song played on both discs will sound more smooth and dynamic on the DVD-Audio disc.\nSince digital information only estimates analog data, an analog signal is actually more accurate than a digital signal.  However, computers only work with digital information, so storing data digitally makes more sense.  Unlike analog data, digital information can also be copied, edited, and moved without losing any quality.  Because of the benefits digital information offers, it has become the most common way of storing and reading data.\nFor more information on analog and digital technology, view the Help Center article."

These assets are not tangible, meaning they have no physical presence.  Instead, they are files that reside on storage device, such as a local computer or a cloud-based storage network.\nThe term \"digital asset\" ascribes legal ownership and value to a digital file.  For example, if you pay $1.29 to download a song from iTunes, it becomes a digital asset since you own the song.  Any stock photos you purchase are digital assets since you own the usage rights.  When you buy a software application, it becomes a digital asset since you own a license to use the software.\n\"Digital asset\" is also important in regards to copyright law.  While you own a song or video that you purchase online, the publisher or artist still owns the copyright to the content.  This means you cannot copy, distribute, or sell the digital content.  Similarly, you own the copyright to photos that you take with your digital camera or smartphone.\nDigital Assets and the DMCA\nUnlike tangible assets, digital assets are easy to copy and share.  Therefore, it is essential to assign legal rights to digital data.  The United States government passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998, which help protects digital data and intellectual property.  It criminalizes the unauthorized dissemination of copyrighted digital content.  It also requires individuals and companies to stop publishing or sharing digital data once they have been informed of a copyright infringement.  This law has helped protect digital media and unique content on the web.\nNOTE: Since digital data is saved in a binary format, digital assets are simply ones and zeros saved to a storage device.  This may seem trivial, but millions or billions of ones and zeros can be used to store all types of digital content, including source code, documents, images, videos, webpages, and applications.

Instead of saving the picture on analog film like traditional cameras, digital cameras save photos in digital memory.  Some digital cameras have built-in memory, but most use an SD or Compact Flash card.\nDigital cameras have several advantages over their analog counterparts.  While film rolls typically hold about 24 pictures, memory cards have the capacity to store several hundred or even several thousand pictures on a single card.  Therefore, photographers can be much more liberal in the shots they take.  Since the images are captured digitally, unwanted images can be deleted directly on the camera.  Most digital cameras also include a small LCD screen that shows a live preview of the image, which makes it easier to capture the perfect picture.  These cameras usually include an option to record video as well.\nIn the past, people would need to drop off their film at a photo processing location in order to get their pictures developed.  With digital cameras, you can simply import the pictures to your computer via a USB cable.  Once the digital photos have been imported, you can publish them online or e-mail them to friends.  You can also edit them using photo editing software.  If you want to print hard copies of your photos, you can use a home printer or an online printing service.\nDigital cameras range greatly in size in quality.

In the mid range are are standalone point-and-shoot cameras that have additional features and picture taking modes.  On the high end are digital SLR (single lens reflex) cameras, which support interchangeable lenses.  These cameras are used by photography professionals and capture high resolution images with accurate color.\nWhile early digital cameras did not perform as well as their film-based counterparts, modern digital cameras can now capture even higher quality images.  Today's point-and-shoot cameras now have resolutions in excess of 10 megapixels, which allows them to capture crystal clear images.  They also focus and capture images much faster than before, which gives them the responsiveness of analog cameras.

Computers must digitize analog input because they are digital devices and cannot process analog information.\nDigital recordings are created by taking samples of analog data, typically at the rate of several thousand per second.  For example, CD audio is digitized using a sample rate of 44.1 kilohertz (kHz).  That means the analog signal is sampled at 44,100 times every second.  The greater the sampling rate, the better the quality (or higher the fidelity) of the digitized file.\nAnalog data is digitized using a device called an ADC or \"analog-to-digital converter.\"  This may be a standalone box or simply a small chip inside a computer.  When converting professional audio or video from analog to digital, it is important to use a high-quality ADC to maintain the character of the original recording.  The opposite of an ADC is a DAC, which converts digital data to analog.\nSince digitizing takes small samples an analog signal, the result is an estimation of the original data.  Therefore analog data is actually more accurate than digitized data.  However, as long as a high enough sampling rate is used, humans perceive digitized audio and video as a steady stream of analog information.

            "A diode is an electrical component designed to conduct electric current in only one direction.  It has two ends (or terminals), each with an electrode of a different charge.  The \"anode\" end has a positive charge relative to the negatively charged \"cathode\" end.  Current naturally flows in the direction from the anode to the cathode.\nDiodes commonly serve as switches, allowing or preventing the flow of current.  For example, current can be stopped by simply reversing an active diode inside an electrical circuit.  Flipping the diode back to the original position will allow electricity to continue flowing through the circuit.  Multiple diodes within a circuit can be used as logic gates, performing AND and OR functions.\nWhile current generally flows through a diode in one direction, in some cases the current can be reversed.  If the negative voltage applied to a diode exceeds the \"breakdown voltage,\" the current will begin flowing in the opposite direction.  The breakdown voltage of a typical diode ranges from -50 to -100 volts, though the amount can be significantly less or more based on the design and materials used in the diode.  Some diodes can be damaged by the reverse flow of current, while others are designed to allow current to flow in both directions.  Zener diodes, for instance, are designed with specific breakdown voltages for different applications.\nAnother common type of diode is a light-emitting diode, or LED.  Light emitting diodes generate visible light when current passes between the anode and cathode though a space called the p-n junction.  The electrical charge in this space produces light in different colors depending on the charge and materials used in the diode."

            "Direct digital marketing, also known as \"DDM,\" is a type of marketing that is done exclusively through digital means.  It may be used to supplement or even replace traditional physical marketing strategies.  The primary channels of direct digital marketing include e-mail and the Web.\nWhile most of us still receive an abundance of physical marketing materials in our mailboxes each week, many of these mailings have been replaced by e-mail.  By using e-mail marketing, companies can drastically reduce their mailing costs, since the cost of sending e-mail messages is essentially free.  Compare this to mailing physical brochures that may cost $0.50 per recipient.  If a company sends out one million mailings, using e-mail could save the company $500,000 in mailing costs.\nWhile e-mail marketing is great asset for many businesses, it can also be abused.  Since it doesn't cost anything to send e-mail messages, it is possible to distribute unsolicited messages to large lists of recipients at little to no cost.  This kind of unwanted electronic junk mail has become widely known as \"spam.\"  Fortunately, junk mail filters have helped reduce the impact of these messages for most users.  Many companies and organizations also offer an \"unsubscribe\" option in their mailings, which allow users to remove themselves from the mailing lists.\nThe Web is another popular medium for direct digital marketing.  Many companies now advertise on websites through banner ads, text links, and other types of advertisements.  By using Web marketing, companies can drive visitors directly to their website with a single click.  This provides a tangible benefit over print and television advertising, which may fully not capture a viewer's interest.  Additionally, companies can target their ads on pages with relevant content using contextual ad placement services, such as Google AdSense.  This allows businesses to attract people who are the most likely to be interested in the products or services they offer.\nIn the past few years, DDM has revolutionized the marketing industry.  By using digital communications, businesses can advertise in several new ways that were not possible before.  While e-mail and the Web remain the most popular mediums for DDM, digital marketing continues to expand into other areas as well.  Mobile phones and video games are already being used for DDM and you can expect many other mediums to follow."

            "Dithering is a process that uses digital noise to smooth out colors in digital graphics and sounds in digital audio.\nDigital Graphics\nAll digital photos are an approximation of the original subject, since computers cannot display an infinite amount of colors.  Instead, the colors are estimated, or rounded to the closest color available.  For example, an 8-bit GIF image can only include 256 (2^8) colors.  This may be enough for a logo or computer graphic, but is too few colors to accurately represent a digital photo.  (This is why most digital photos are saved as 16 or 24-bit JPEG images, since they support thousands or millions of colors.)\nWhen digital photos contain only a few hundred colors, they typically look blotchy, since large areas are represented by single colors.  Dithering can be used to reduce this blotchy appearance by adding digital noise to smooth out the transitions between colors.  This \"noise\" adds makes the photo appear more grainy, but gives it a more accurate representation since the colors blend together more smoothly.  In fact, if you view a dithered 256-color image from far away, it may look identical to the same image that is represented by thousands or millions of colors.\nDigital Audio\nLike digital images, digital audio recordings are approximations of the original analog source.  Therefore, if the sampling rate or bit depth of an audio file is too low, it may sound choppy or rough.  Dithering can be applied to the audio file to smooth out the roughness.  Similar to dithering a digital image, audio dithering adds digital noise to the audio to smooth out the sound.  If you view a dithered waveform in an audio editor, it will appear less blocky.  More importantly, if you listen to a dithered audio track, it should sound smoother and more like the original analog sound.\nSummary\nSeveral types of dithering algorithms are used by various image and audio editors, though random dithering is the most common.  While dithering is often used to improve the appearance and sound of low quality graphics and audio, it can also be applied to high quality images and recordings.  In these situations, dithering may still provide extra smoothness to the image or sound."

Examples include identifying unknown file types and viewing file metadata.\nIt is possible to perform document grinding on both plain text and binary files.\nText Files\nGrinding text files is a simple process since they store data as plain text.  You can search for characters and strings within a text document using a tool like grep or another search utility.  Since text processing is a relatively fast computer operation, it may be possible to grind several large documents in less than a second.\nCommon text file types targeted for document grinding include log files (.LOG, .TXT) and configuration files (.CONF, .CNF).  If a hacker gains access to a web server, for example, he may search these files for usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.\nBinary Files\nBinary files may contain some plain text, but they also store binary data \u2014 1s and 0s.  It is more difficult to grind binary data since it cannot be searched with a text search tool.  Additionally, many binary files are saved in a proprietary file format, which is difficult to parse without the corresponding application.  Therefore binary document grinding typically focuses on the header and footer of a document, which may contain plain text.  It may also aim to extract file metadata.\nMany binary files contain information about the file type in the header of the file.  For example, in the sample image, the letters \"PNG\" in the header indicate the file is a PNG image.  This information is useful for identifying the file type since it does not have a file extension.  Similarly, digital photos often contain hidden EXIF data saved when the photo was taken.

Therefore, the more dots that are used, the more clear and accurate the image representation will be.  For example, a 16x16 dot matrix can represent the letter \"S\" more accurately than a 8x8 matrix.  If enough dots are used, the image will appear as a contiguous display rather than a group of dots.  This is because the human eye blends the dots together to create a coherent image.  For example, newspaper print is made up of dot matrixes, but it is hard to notice unless you look very closely at the paper.\nBitmap images on a computer screen are also dot matrixes, since they are made up of a rectangular grid of pixels.  If you look closely enough at your monitor, you may even be able to see the dots that make up the image.

The smaller the dot pitch, the sharper the picture.\nDot pitch applies to both CRT monitors and flat-screen displays.  While some large-screen CRTs have dot-pitches as high as 0.51 mm, most computer displays have a dot pitch between 0.25 and 0.28 mm.  Similarly, most LCD displays have a dot pitch between 0.20 and 0.28 mm.  Some high-end displays used for scientific or medical imagery have dot pitches as low as 0.15 mm.

To perform a double click, and not just two clicks, the mouse button must be pressed twice within a very short time, typically about half a second.  Most operating systems allow you to lengthen or shorten the maximum time allowed for a double click, using the Mouse Control Panel or System Preference.\nA double click is recognized by your computer as a specific command, just like pressing a key on your keyboard.  Double clicking is used to to perform a variety of actions, such as opening a program, opening a folder, or selecting a word of text.  In order to double click an object, just move the cursor over the item and press the left mouse button quickly two times."

            "Download can be used as either a verb or a noun.  As a verb, it refers to the process of receiving data over the Internet.  Downloading is the opposite of uploading, or sending data to another system over the Internet.  As a noun, download may refer to either a file that is retrieved from the Internet or the process of downloading a file.  \nEvery time you use the Internet, you download data.  For example, each time you visit a webpage, your computer or mobile device must download the HTML, CSS, images, and any other relevant data in order to display the page in your web browser.  When you click a \"Download Now\" link, your browser will start downloading a specific file that you can open.\nYou can also download data using mediums besides the web.  For example, you can download files using an FTP program, download email messages with an email client, and download software updates directly through your operating system.  You can manually initiate a download (such as clicking a download link), though most downloads happen automatically.  For example, your smartphone may download email messages and software updates in the background without you knowing it.\nWhile you can download a file, the word \"download\" may also refer to the file itself.  A common way you might see \"download\" used as a noun is in an online advertisement that says, \"Free Download.\"  This phrase implies that clicking the download link will download a file (often a software program or installer) and use it for free.  The noun \"download\" can also be used like the word \"transfer\" to describe the process of downloading data.  For example, a program may display a status update that says, \"Download in progress\" or \"Download complete.\""

            "Downtime is a period when a system is not available.  It may apply to any computer or network, but is most commonly used in reference to servers.  In particular, web server reliability is often measured in terms of downtime, where little to no downtime is ideal.\nThere are several reasons why a server may experience downtime:\n\nServer reboot - Restarting a server may require a few minutes of downtime because the system must shut down, reboot, then restart the necessary processes in order to respond to incoming requests.\nSoftware restart - Restarting a process, such as Apache on a web server, may cause a few seconds of downtime while the process is restarting.\nNetwork disconnect - If a server is physically disconnected from a network, it will not be reachable by the systems on the network.\nNetwork outage - If any part of a network (including the Internet) is not functioning between the server and client, the client will not be able to communicate with the server.\nTraffic overload - If a server receives more traffic than it can handle, it will not be able to respond to all the requests.  Users may experience downtime until the traffic decreases.  This may be caused by a spike in traffic or a DDoS attack.\nHardware failure - If an important hardware component, such as an HDD or SSD fails, it may cause the server to stop functioning.\nSoftware failure - If a process on a server, such as the httpd (HTTP) service stops running, it will cause the server to be unresponsive to requests until the process is restarted.\nPower outage - If the electrical power goes out and no backup power is available (for example, a generator or UPS), any affected systems will be offline until power is restored.\nHacker attack - If a hacker gains control of a server, he or she may prevent access to the required services, causing the server to stop responding.\n\nIn order to minimize downtime, server administrators must implement strong security measures and redundancy.  Network security helps protect against malicious activity, such as unauthorized logins and DDoS attacks.  Redundancy, such as RAID storage systems and backup power generators, help prevent downtime due to hardware failure.  In some cases, multiple servers may be configured so that a secondary server can take over if the primary server fails.\nWhile server admins try to minimize downtime as much as possible, sometimes downtime is unavoidable.  For example, when performing a server migration, several minutes or even a few hours of downtime may be necessary.  This type of \"planned downtime\" is typically scheduled for early morning or weekend hours when traffic levels are lowest."

Some word processing programs allow you to select text and drag the selected text to another place in the document.  To select the text, you may have to \"drag\" the mouse over the text you want to select.\nDragging is an important technique for using today's graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  In fact, there are many other things you can drag besides icons.  For example, you can drag the top of windows to reposition them, you can drag the scroll bar in open documents or Web pages to scroll through them, and you can drag messages to different folders in your mail program.  Other programs, such as video games and image-editing programs use dragging to reposition items on the screen.\nTo drag an item, first move the cursor over the item you want to drag.  Then click and hold down the left mouse button to \"grab\" the item.  Move the mouse to position the item where you want it.  Let go of the mouse button once you have moved the item to \"release\" it.  This technique is known as a \"drag and drop.\""

This is called \"dragging\" the object.  Once you have moved the object where you want to place it, you can lift up the mouse button to \"drop\" the object in the new location.  If you are using a touchscreen device, you can select an item by simply touching it with your finger.  (Some interfaces may require you to hold your finger on the object for a second or two to select it.)  Then you drag the item by moving your finger across the screen to the location where you want to place it.  To drop the object, simply lift your finger off the screen.\nDrag and drop can be used for multiple purposes.  For example, you can drag and drop an icon on the desktop to move it to a folder.  You can drag and drop an open window by clicking the title bar and moving it to a new location.  Some programs allow you to open files by dragging and dropping file icons directly onto the application icon.  Many programs allow you to customize the workspace by dragging and dropping interface elements in different locations on the screen.  Computer games, like chess, typically allow you to move objects in the game using a drag and drop action.\nNOTE: Since drag and drop is a simple and intuitive way to work with objects, software programs often promote \"drag and drop editing\" capability, which implies the software is easy to use."

All drives store nonvolatile data, meaning the data is not erased when the power is turned off.\nOver the past several decades, drives have evolved along with other computer technologies.  Below is a list of different types of computer drives.\n\n5.25 inch floppy drive - uses flexible removable media drive, stores up to 800 KB per floppy disk, popular in the 1980s\n3.5 inch floppy drive - uses more rigid removable media, stores up to 1.44 MB per disk, popular in the 1990s\nOptical drive - uses removable optical media such as CDs (800 MB), DVDs (4.7 - 17 GB), and Blu-ray discs (25-50 GB), available in both read-only and writable models, popular in the 2000s\nFlash drive - a small, highly portable storage device that uses flash memory and connects directly to a USB port\nHDD (hard disk drive) - the most common internal storage device used by computers over the past several decades, can store several terabytes (TB) of data\nSSD (solid state drive) - serves the same purpose as a hard drive but contains no moving parts; uses flash memory and provides faster performance than a hard drive\n\nWhile there are many different types of drives, they are all considered secondary memory since they are not accessed directly by the CPU.  Instead, when a computer reads data from a drive, the data first gets sent to the RAM so that it can be accessed more quickly.  Even the fastest drives, likes SSDs, have much slower read\/write speeds than RAM.\nWhy are computer drives called \"drives?\"\nWhile an official answer remains elusive, a compelling reason is that early drives required a rotating device that would spin or \"drive\" the disk.  While some modern drives have no moving parts, the legacy term \"drive\" seems to have stuck."

For example, if a hacker gains access to a trusted website, he can install code on webpages that will initiate automatic downloads on visitors' computers.  Malicious websites, such as those used in phishing and pharming activities, may intentionally download malware on users computers.\nThere are multiple ways a webmaster can implement drive-by downloads in a webpage.  One method is to insert JavaScript code that automatically opens a downloadable file once the page has loaded.  Another method involves using an iframe that references another URL, which initiates the download.  A less common method is to use a browser plug-in or extension that downloads files automatically.  In rare cases, online advertisers can even insert code in display ads that initiate downloads on users computers.  Most ad networks now prevent this type of behavior.\nWhile drive-by downloads happen automatically, it is rare that the an executable file will run without your permission.

Some keyboard drivers allow you to assign functions to specific keys, such as controlling the volume or opening specific applications.\nThere are several different ways to install drivers.  For some devices, such as printers, the operating system may automatically find and install the correct drivers when the device is connected.  In other cases, drivers can be installed from a CD or DVD provided with the hardware.

When you click one of the options in the menu bar, such as \"File\", a list of options will appear below the menu, such as New, Open, Close, and Save.  You can click any of these options to select it.\nDrop down menus are also commonly used for website navigation.  Many websites use drop down menus to provide users with direct links to more pages than standard navigation bars allow.  For example, a news website may list several news categories in the main menu, such as Politics, Business, Sports, and Entertainment.  Each of these menu options may include several subcategories.  For example, the Sports menu may contain options such Baseball, Basketball, Football, Hockey, and Soccer.  By selecting a specific sport within the Sports menu, you can navigate to the section you want with one click, instead of having to visit the main Sports page first.\nWebsite drop down menus are typically created using DHTML (dynamic HTML), which may include a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.  They can also be written as Flash applications.  While software program menus typically require you to click on the main menu to reveal the drop down options, website drop down menus often appear when you simply move the cursor over the main menu.  Clicking a main menu option at the top of a website drop down menu may open the main topic page (like the Sports page in the example above).

While most computers automatically load a specific operating system (OS) at startup, a dual boot system allows you to choose what OS you would like to load.  For example, a dual boot Windows system may provide an option to load either Windows 7 or Windows 8 at startup.  Linux and Mac OS X users can install Windows to create a Linux\/Windows or Mac\/Windows dual boot configuration.\nDual boot systems are often used by computer enthusiasts, who prefer different operating systems for different tasks or want to run OS-specific applications.  Software developers also use dual boot systems to test their software on multiple operating systems.  A single dual boot system is more efficient than buying and setting up two separate computers.\nIn order to create a dual boot system, you first need to install a custom boot manager or \"boot loader.\"  This is a small program that loads near the beginning of the boot sequence before the OS loads.  Common PC boot loaders include LILO and GRUB, which support Linux and Windows.  Mac users can install Apple's Boot Camp utility.  In most cases, you will need to install each operating system on a separate partitions.  Linux installations may require multiple partitions just for the Linux OS.  While the disk partitioning can be done manually, it is typically accomplished using a dual boot utility like EasyBCD (Windows) or Boot Camp (Mac OS X).\nWhile many users still create dual boot machines, virtualization has become a more common way to run multiple operating systems on a single computer.  Unlike dual booting, virtualization allows you to run multiple operating systems at the same time and switch between them without restarting.  However, booting into a specific OS typically yields the best performance.\nNOTE: Dual boot may also be called \"multi boot,\" which refers to a computer than can load two or more different operating systems."

            "Dual processor refers to a computer with two separate processors.  The processors work in tandem to process data using a technique called multiprocessing.  Instructions are split between the two processors (or CPUs), allowing the computer to perform faster than a similar machine with only one processor.\nIn theory, two CPUs can process twice as much data per second than a single CPU.  However, because the two processors share resources, such as L2 and L3 caches, busses, and system memory, there are bottlenecks that slow down the overall performance.  Also, programs must be written to take advantage of multiprocessing, meaning the performance of an application on a dual processor machine is dependent on how the application is written.  As a result, dual processor machines are noticeably faster than single processor machines, but rarely twice as fast.\nDual Processor vs Dual-Core\nDual processor is similar to dual-core, but different.  A dual processor computer has two separate CPUs, which are physically separated on the motherboard.  The two processors may share resources (like the CPU bus and cache), but are physically separate.  In a dual-core system, the two processors are combined into a single chip that may look like one processor.  Since the processors are combined into one entity, they may collectively be called a single dual-core CPU.\nWhile dual processor and dual-core have two different meanings, they are not mutually exclusive.  Some systems have two dual-core CPUs, totally four processing cores.  Desktop computers may have four, six, or eight separate processors.  High-end scientific computing machines can go way beyond dual processor configurations and may include dozens of processors."

Each processor has its own cache and controller, which enables it to function as efficiently as a single processor.  However, because the two processors are linked together, they can perform operations up to twice as fast as a single processor can.\nThe Intel Core Duo, the AMD X2, and the dual-core PowerPC G5 are all examples of CPUs that use dual-core technologies.  These CPUs each combine two processor cores on a single silicon chip.  This is different than a \"dual processor\" configuration, in which two physically separate CPUs work together.  However, some high-end machines, such as the PowerPC G5 Quad, use two separate dual-core processors together, providing up to four times the performance of a single processor.\nWhile a dual-core system has twice the processing power of a single-processor machine, it does not always perform twice as fast.  This is because the software running on the machine may not be able to take full advantage or both processors.  Some operating systems and programs are optimized for multiprocessing, while others are not.  Though programs that have been optimized for multiple processors will run especially fast on dual-core systems, most programs will see at least some benefit from multiple processors as well."

He designed the keyboard as alternative to the standard QWERTY keyboard layout, with the goal of improving typing ergonomics.\nDvorak developed the new keyboard layout after studying common typing patterns.  He determined the QWERTY layout, which was designed for telegraph operators and early typewriters, was inefficient.  It required awkward motions, didn't use the home row (ASDF) enough, and required many common key patterns to be typed with one hand.\nTo improve typing efficiency, Dvorak designed his keyboard layout to alternate keystrokes between left and right hands.  He also placed the most common letters in the home row.  For example, since nearly all words have vowels, the home row on the Dvorak keyboard begins with the letters AOEUI.  The vowel keys are placed next to each other since vowels often alternate with consonants.\nDvorak patented his keyboard layout in 1936, claiming layout offered the faster typing speeds, greater accuracy, and less fatigue than the QWERTY keyboard.  Despite these benefits, the Dvorak keyboard has never achieved the popularity of the QWERTY layout.  Most people still learn to type on a QWERTY keyboard and simply do not want to relearn a new keyboard layout.  Therefore, nearly all desktop computers and laptops sold in Western countries come with QWERTY keyboards.\nNOTE: The original version of the Dvorak keyboard is also known as the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (DSK).  In 1982, ANSI standardized a slight variation of the Dvorak keyboard layout, called the American Simplified Keyboard (ASK)."

This is because static pages each contain unique content, meaning they must be manually opened, edited, and published whenever a change is made.  Dynamic pages, on the other hand, access information from a database.  Therefore, to alter the content of a dynamic page, the webmaster may only need to update a database record.  This is especially helpful for large sites that contain hundreds or thousands of pages.  It also makes it possible for multiple users to update the content of a website without editing the layout of the pages.\nDynamic websites that access information from a database are also called database-driven websites."
