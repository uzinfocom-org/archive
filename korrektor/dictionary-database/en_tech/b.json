Since then, the language has evolved into a more robust and powerful language and can be used to create advanced programs for today's computer systems.\nBASIC originally used numbers at the beginning of each instruction (or line) to tell the computer what order to process the instructions.  Lines would be numbered as 10, 20, 30, etc., which would allow additional instructions to be placed between commands later on if needed.  \"GOTO\" statements enabled programs to loop back to earlier instructions during execution.  For example, line 230 of a BASIC program may have an \"if\" clause that tells the computer to jump back to line 50 if a variable is less than 10.  This instruction might look something like this:\n230 IF (N < 10) THEN GOTO 50\nMore modern BASIC implementations use \"while loops,\" which perform a series of instructions as long as a certain case is true.  Newer BASIC development software also supports more data types, such as integers, strings, and arrays, for storing variables and other data.  While the first BASIC development environments were strictly text-based, today's BASIC programming software allows developers to design much of their programs visually, using a graphical user interface.  Some of the more popular BASIC development programs used today include REALbasic and Microsoft Visual Basic."

It helps determine the most efficient path, whether sending data down the street or across the globe.\nBGP manages the flow of data similar to how the post office handles the delivery of physical mail.  For example, when a user in Los Angeles accesses a website in New York, BGP first routes the data from the New York-based server to the Internet backbone.  The data travels through large fiber optic cables across state lines, then through smaller networks until it arrives at the user's ISP in Los Angeles.  The ISP then routes the data locally to the user's device.\nEach router along the data transmission route is called a \"hop.\"  You can view the hops between your location and a server using a traceroute command, such as the ones below:Unix - traceroute techterms.comDOS -  tracert techterms.com\nFundamental to the Border Gateway Protocol are routing tables, which are plain text files that list available routers by IP address.  BGP routers use these tables to determine the best path for each data transmission.  Routing tables are frequently updated since the fastest route can change based on network traffic and outages.  High-traffic routers may request updates once a minute or even every few seconds.\nBenefits of BGP\n\nA standard means of communication between routers\nEfficient routing of data over the Internet\nAdaptability for network congestion\nRedundancy when network outages occur\nScalability to add or remove routers\nAutonomous operation\n\nNOTE: While BGP enables efficient routing of data across long distances, CDNs provide an even greater benefit by hosting data at \"edge nodes\" around the world."

The BIOS is a program pre-installed on Windows-based computers (not on Macs) that the computer uses to start up.  The CPU accesses the BIOS even before the operating system is loaded.  The BIOS then checks all your hardware connections and locates all your devices. If everything is OK, the BIOS loads the operating system into the computer's memory and finishes the boot-up process.\nSince the BIOS manages the hard drives, it can't reside on one, and since it is available before the computer boots up, it can't live in the RAM.  So where can this amazing, yet elusive BIOS be found?  It is actually located in the ROM (Read-Only Memory) of the computer.  More specifically, it resides in an eraseable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) chip.  So, as soon as you turn your computer on, the CPU accesses the EPROM and gives control to the BIOS.\nThe BIOS also is used after the computer has booted up.  It acts as an intermediary between the CPU and the I\/O (input\/output) devices.  Because of the BIOS, your programs and your operating system don't have to know exact details (like hardware addresses) about the I\/O devices attached to your PC.  When device details change, only the BIOS needs to be updated.  You can make these changes by entering the BIOS when your system starts up.

Other applications do not need a strong signal and require less electrical power.   BLE is was developed for these types of applications.  Examples include:\n\nwearable devices, such as fitness trackers\nsmart home appliances\nproximity sensors\n\nA proximity sensor, such as a Google Beacon or Apple iBeacon, only needs to transmit a small signal every second or so to detect nearby Bluetooth devices.  This requires significantly less power than streaming high-fidelity stereo audio to a Bluetooth speaker or headset.  Developers can use BLE-specific communication in their apps to significantly reduce the electrical power used by a smartphone, smartwatch, or other device.\nBLE Advantages\nThe primary advantage of BLE compared to \"Classic Bluetooth\" is lower power consumption, which translates to longer battery life.  For example, BLE can run for multiple years on a single coin-cell battery, such as a CR2032 battery used in wristwatches.  Bluetooth LE can also communicate over a longer range than the 100-meter distance Classic Bluetooth supports.  It also supports fast connection setup with a latency of 3 ms compared to the 100 ms latency of Classic Bluetooth.\nNOTE: BLE is supported by all Bluetooth 4.0 devices as long as the device software also supports it."

It is called the \"blue screen of death\" because it is displayed when the computer has encountered a \"fatal error\" and must be restarted.\nTechnically, the BSOD is caused by a Windows STOP error.  STOP errors are critical system-level errors that cause the computer to stop responding in order to prevent data corruption or damage to the hardware.  Several different problems can cause a STOP error, including kernel crashes, boot loader errors, driver malfunctions, and hardware faults.  When a STOP error occurs, the BSOD is displayed, along with a message that provides information about the specific error that has occurred.\nThe good news is that the BSOD protects your data and prevents damage to your PC.  The bad news is that it halts the entire system, which may cause you to lose unsaved files that you were currently working on.  In some cases, the BSOD will produce a \"memory dump\" of the current data stored in RAM, which is saved to the primary storage device.  This dump can be opened and analyzed after the computer is restarted, though it is often difficult to extract usable data from this file.  Your best chance of recovering work after a BSOD is if the application you were using includes an \"autosave\" feature that saves a temporary version of your work at regular intervals.  If your computer crashes while you are working, the program should automatically open the temporary file the next time you launch the program.\nNOTE: In Windows 8, the blue screen of death has a softer \"aqua\" blue background and often provides more readable error messages than in previous versions of Windows.

Operating system vulnerabilities are the most serious because once a hacker gains system-level access, he may have full access to all programs and data on the system.  Application security holes are also serious since they may allow hackers to view or alter data on a computer and may more difficult to detect.\nExamples of malware that may facilitate backdoor access include:\n\nViruses\nRootkits\nTrojans\nSpyware\n\nIn some cases, backdoor hacks are immediately apparent since they affect the functionality of the system.  In other cases, they may go undetected for hours, days, or even months.  Long-term access is especially problematic since it provides hackers extra time to access, alter, and download data.  For this reason, servers often have monitoring software that checks for unrecognized processes running on the system.  Most antivirus software runs similar security checks.\nBackdoor Attacks vs Other Cyberattacks\nA backdoor attack is the opposite of a brute force attack, which attempts to gain access to a system through the standard login interface.  Backdoor access bypasses the typical username and password authentication and gains access to the underlying system.\nViruses and other malware are not considered backdoor hacks, but instead, they facilitate backdoor access.  For example, a malware program may install a script that provides a hacker with admin access to the system, even after the malware has been removed.

It contrasts with the frontend, which refers to a program's or website's user interface.  In programming terminology, the backend is the \"data access layer,\" while the frontend is the \"presentation layer.\"\nMost modern websites are dynamic, meaning webpage content is generated on-the-fly.  A dynamic page contains one or more scripts that run on the web server each time the page is accessed.  These scripts generate the content of the page, which is sent to the user's web browser.  Everything that happens before the page is displayed in a web browser is part of the backend.\nExamples of backend processes include:\n\nprocessing an incoming webpage request\nrunning a script (PHP, ASP, JSP, etc.) to generate HTML\naccessing data, such as an article, from a database using an SQL queries\nstoring or updating records in a database\nencrypting and decrypting data\nhandling file uploads and downloads\nprocessing user input via JavaScript\n\nAll of the examples above, besides the last one, are server-side processes that run on the web server.  JavaScript is a client-side process, meaning it runs in the web browser.  JavaScript may be considered a backend or a frontend process, depending on if the code affects the user interface or not.\nThe backend and frontend work together to create the full user experience.  Data generated in the backend is passed to the frontend and presented to the user.  While some organizations have separate backend and frontend development teams, the line between the two layers is rarely black and white.  Therefore, many developers write code for both the backend and frontend.  This is known as full-stack development.\nNOTE: Backend may also be written \"back end\" (as a noun) or \"back-end\" (as an adjective).  For simplicity, \"backend\" (the closed compound word) has become an acceptable term for both."

Better yet, you could save the backups to a USB flash disk, which would also protect the files if the hard drive failed.\nHard drives are meant to run for many years without crashing.  But just like all electronic devices, they are not immune to problems.  Because they are not solid state devices, hard drives rely on moving parts to access data, which can malfunction and cause your data to become unrecoverable.

Files can be mistakenly deleted or corrupted by viruses or other software attacks.  Program installation conflicts can make applications or files unusable.  There are unfortunately many ways for your data to become damaged or disappear.\nThat is why it is so important to backup your data.

The best way is to use an external storage device, such as an external hard drive, flash memory device, or even another computer.  You can also create permanent backups using optical media, such as CD-R and DVD-R discs.  Backing up individual folders and files is as easy copying them from the source media (your computer's hard disk) to the destination (an external hard drive).  If you want to backup your entire system or would like to have regular backups automatically performed, you can use backup software that will backup your data for you.  Many programs are available for both Mac and Windows that provide automatic backups and system restore capabilities.\nIf you have not yet backed up your hard drive, now is a good time to do so.

For example, a gigabit Ethernet connection has a bandwidth of 1,000 Mbps (125 megabytes per second).  An Internet connection via cable modem may provide 25 Mbps of bandwidth.\nWhile bandwidth is used to describe network speeds, it does not measure how fast bits of data move from one location to another.  Since data packets travel over electronic or fiber optic cables, the speed of each bit transferred is negligible.   Instead, bandwidth measures how much data can flow through a specific connection at one time.\nWhen visualizing bandwidth, it may help to think of a network connection as a tube and each bit of data as a grain of sand.  If you pour a large amount of sand into a skinny tube, it will take a long time for the sand to flow through it.  If you pour the same amount of sand through a wide tube, the sand will finish flowing through the tube much faster.  Similarly, a download will finish much faster when you have a high-bandwidth connection rather than a low-bandwidth connection.\nData often flows over multiple network connections, which means the connection with the smallest bandwidth acts as a bottleneck.  Generally, the Internet backbone and connections between servers have the most bandwidth, so they rarely serve as bottlenecks.  Instead, the most common Internet bottleneck is your connection to your ISP.\nNOTE: Bandwidth also refers to a range of frequencies used to transmit a signal.

Newer versions of Bash support regular expressions (Bash 3.0) and associative arrays (Bash 4.0).\nBash was originally developed by Brian Fox for the GNU Project and was released in 1989.  The bash shell was initially distributed with the GNU operating system and later became the default shell for multiple Linux distributions and Mac OS X.  Recent versions of Bash (versions 3 and 4) were developed by Chet Ramey and are currently published by the Free Software Foundation, the same organization that distributes the GNU operating system."

For example, if a signal changes (or could change) 1200 times in one second, it would be measured at 1200 baud.  While the term was originally used to measure the rate of electronic pulses, it has also become a way to measure data transmission speeds of dial-up modems.\nIf a modem transfers a single bit per electronic pulse, one baud would be equal to one bit per second (bps).  However, most modems transfer multiple bits per signal transition.  For example, a 28.8 Kbps modem may send nine bits per second.  Therefore, it would only require a baud rate of 2100 (28,800 \/ 9).  56K modems often use a baud rate of 8000.  This means they send seven bits per signal transition, since 7 x 8000 = 56,000.\nModems typically select the most efficient baud rate automatically (sometimes called the \"autobaud\" setting).  However, many dial-up modems allow you to override the default baud setting and manually enter the baud rate using a software interface.  This can be useful if a dial-up ISP requires a specific baud rate for communication.  However, reducing the baud rate of a modem may also reduce the maximum data transmission rate.\nBaud rates above 8000 are not very reliable on analog telephone lines, which is why most modems do not offer higher baud settings.  Additionally, at such a high baud rate, only seven bits can be sent consistently with each pulse, which is why dial-up modem speeds maxed out at 56 Kbps many years ago.  Fortunately, newer technologies such as DSL and cable modems offer much faster data transfer rates.  Since DSL and cable modems communicate over digital lines, baud rate is irrelevant to these devices."

Each format uses a different type of compression, but they all represent an image as a grid of pixels.  Compressed bitmaps are significantly smaller than uncompressed BMP files and can be downloaded more quickly.  Therefore, most images you see on the web are compressed bitmaps.\nIf you zoom into a bitmap image, regardless of the file format, it will look blocky because each dot will take up more than one pixel.

While bloatware may refer to the first version of a software program, it most often describes programs that require increasing amounts of system resources with each new version.\nIt is generally considered good programming practice to develop efficient applications.  A well-developed program should not require more RAM or disk space than necessary.  However, in some cases a developer may prioritize a specific release date or new features over efficiency.  This can result in a bloated application that uses far more storage space and memory than the previous version.\nNew versions of software programs typically include new features, which provide an incentive for users to upgrade.  However, with each new release, the program's system requirements may also grow.  If left unchecked, after a few versions, a once efficient application can turn into bloatware.  To avoid this, some software developers make an intentional effort to trim unnecessary features when adding new ones.\nCommon examples of software that may be considered bloatware include Microsoft Windows, Apple iTunes, and Adobe Reader."

Blockchains are used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and have many other applications.\nEach transaction added to a blockchain is validated by multiple computers on the Internet.  These systems, which are configured to monitor specific types of blockchain transactions, form a peer-to-peer network.  They work together to ensure each transaction is valid before it is added to the blockchain.  This decentralized network of computers ensures a single system cannot add invalid blocks to the chain.  \nWhen a new block is added to a blockchain, it is linked to the previous block using a cryptographic hash generated from the contents of the previous block.  This ensures the chain is never broken and that each block is permanently recorded.  It is also intentionally difficult to alter past transactions in blockchain since all the subsequent blocks must be altered first.\nBlockchain Uses\nWhile blockchain is widely known for its use in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether, the technology has several other uses.  For example, it enables \"smart contracts,\" which execute when certain conditions are met.  This provides an automated escrow system for transactions between two parties.  Blockchain can potentially be used to allow individuals to pay each other without a central clearing point, which is required for ACH and wire transfers.  It has potential to greatly increase the efficiency of stock trading by allowing transactions to settle almost instantly instead of requiring three or more days for each transaction to clear.\nBlockchain technology can also be used for non-financial purposes.  For example, the InterPlanetary File System (IFPS) uses blockchain to decentralize file storage by linking files together over the Internet.  Some digital signature platforms now use blockchain to record signatures and verify documents have been digitally signed.  Blockchain can even be used to protect intellectual property by linking the distribution of content to the original source."

Boolean expressions use the operators AND, OR, XOR, and NOT to compare values and return a true or false result.  These boolean operators are described in the following four examples:\n\nx AND y - returns True if both x and y are true; returns False if either x or y are false.\nx OR y - returns True if either x or y, or both x and y are true; returns False only if x and y are both false.\nx XOR y - returns True if only x or y is true; returns False if x and y are both true or both false.\nNOT x - returns True if x is false (or null); returns False if x is true.\n\nSince computers operate in binary (using only zeros and ones), computer logic can often be expressed in boolean terms.  For example, a true statement returns a value of 1, while a false statement returns a value of 0.  Of course, most calculations require more than a simple true\/false statement.  Therefore, computer processors perform complex calculations by linking multiple binary (or boolean) statements together.  Complex boolean expressions can be expressed as a series of logic gates.\nBoolean expressions are also supported by most search engines.  When you enter keywords in a search engine, you can refine your search using boolean operators.  For example, if you want to look up information about the Apple iMac, but want to avoid results about apples (the fruit) you might search for \"Apple AND iMac NOT fruit.\"  This would produce results about iMac computers, while avoiding results with the word \"fruit.\"  While most search engines support boolean operators, their syntax requirements may vary.  For example, instead of the words AND and NOT, the operators \"+\" and \"-\" may be required.  You can look up the correct syntax in the help section of each search engine's website."

When you turn on or restart a computer, it automatically loads a sequence of commands that initializes the system, checks for hardware, and loads the operating system.  This process does not require any user input and is therefore considered a bootstrap process.\nWhile bootstrapping is often associated with the system boot sequence, it can be used by individual applications as well.  For example, a program may automatically run a series of commands when opened.  These commands may process user settings, check for updates, and load dynamic libraries, such as DLL files.  They are considered bootstrap processes because they run automatically as the program is starting up.\nNOTE: Bootstrap is also a popular web development framework used for creating websites.

These bots \"crawl\" websites by following the links on each page.  The crawler saves the contents of each page in the search index.  By using complex algorithms, search engines can display the most relevant pages discovered by web crawlers for specific search queries.\nChat bots were one of the first types of automated programs to be called \"bots\" and became popular in the 1990s, with the rise of online chatrooms.  These bots are scripts that look for certain text patterns submitted by chat room participants and respond with automated actions.  For example, a chat bot might warn a user if his or her language is inappropriate.  If the user does not heed the warning, the bot might kick the user from the channel and may even block the user from returning.  A more advanced type of chat bot, called a \"chatterbot\" can respond to messages in plain English, appearing to be an actual person.  Both types of chat bots are used for chatroom moderation, which eliminates the need for an individual to monitor individual chatrooms.\nWhile most bots are used for productive purposes, some are considered malware, since they perform undesirable functions.  For example, spambots capture email addresses from website contact forms, address books, and email programs, then add them to a spam mailing list.  Site scrapers download entire websites, enabling unauthorized duplication of a website's contents.  DoS bots send automated requests to websites, making them unresponsive.

Returning E-mail\nWhen you send an e-mail message to another person, the mail server processes the message and delivers it to the appropriate user's mailbox.  For example, if you send a message to \"mrman@mail.com,\" the mail.com server looks for a user named \"mrman\" to deliver the message to.  If the user does not exist, the mail server may bounce the message back to the sender, saying \"Sorry, that user does not exist.\"  These messages often come from \"Mail Delivery Subsystem\" and have a subject line that reads \"Returned mail: see transcript for details.\"\nIf you receive a bounced message, you may want to check the e-mail address you sent the message to and make sure it was typed correctly.  If the address is correct, it may help to read the body of the bounced message for more details.  The transcript may say something like \"User quota over limit,\" which means the recipient has reached his or her e-mail quota and must delete some messages and\/or attachments in order to receive new mail.  If this is the case, you may want to call the person or use an alternative e-mail address to let the person know he or she has some Inbox maintenance to do.\n2. Restarting a Computer\nThe term \"bounce\" can also describe the process of rebooting or restarting a computer.  For example, a workstation may need to be bounced after installing new software. Similarly, a Web server may be bounced if websites hosted on the server are not responding correctly.\n3. Exporting Audio\n\"Bounce\" can also describe the process of exporting several tracks in an audio mix to one mono track or two stereo tracks.  This helps consolidate audio tracks after they have been mixed.  Bouncing audio tracks limits the need for processing power since the computer only has to process one track instead of all the tracks individually.  Digital Performer is the primary audio software program that uses bouncing to export audio.\n4. Hiding a Network Connection\nFinally, \"bouncing\" can also be used in networking to describe a method of hiding the source of a user's network connection.

If an update error causes system-level damage, the device may not start up or function at all.  In other words, the electronic device becomes a paperweight or a \"brick.\"\nThe more foundational an update is, the greater its potential to brick a device.  For example, a firmware update is more likely to cause bricking than an operating system update.  An OS update is higher risk than an application update.\nBricking may be caused by an invalid update (such as an attempt to \"jailbreak\" a phone) or an update that does not finish successfully.  To avoid incomplete updates, most firmware and OS updates will not run unless the device is plugged into a power source.\nDevelopers can use preventative measures to prevent bricking.  For example, operating system updates typically wait to overwrite old system files until the new files have been fully downloaded and verified.  Still, if an update fails at a crucial moment, such as when files are being overwritten, the device may become unusable.  If the system cannot boot up and is not updatable, the device is bricked.\nHard vs Soft Bricking\nThere are two types of bricking \u2014 hard and soft.  A hard brick is when a device shows little or no signs of life.  For example, the power button may light up, but the screen will not turn on.  A soft-bricked device functions enough to display an error.  For instance, on startup, the screen may display an error message or icon that indicates the operating system is unable to load.\nA bricked device may or may not be recoverable.  Soft bricks are easier to resolve than hard bricks and can often be fixed by the user.  Hard bricks may require special recovery tools only available through the device manufacturer.  Therefore, if your device is hard-bricked, you may want to bring it to an authorized repair shop before relegating it to a paperweight."

It connects two or more local area networks (LANs) together.  The cars, or the data in this case, use the bridge to travel to and from different areas of the network.  The device is similar to a router, but it does not analyze the data being forwarded.  Because of this, bridges are typically fast at transferring data, but not as versatile as a router.  For example, a bridge cannot be used as a firewall like most routers can.  A bridge can transfer data between different protocols (i.e. a Token Ring and Ethernet network) and operates at the \"data link layer\" or level 2 of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) networking reference model."

Today, it also describes digital broadcasts sent over the Internet.\nOver-The-Air Broadcasting\nEarly broadcasts, such as AM and FM radio, were produced using analog signals transmitted over the air on different frequencies.  In the early 2000s, several over-the-air or \"OTA\" broadcasts either converted to or added digital signals, such as HDTV, HD radio, and satellite radio.  Today, many broadcasting companies transmit both analog and digital signals.\nWhile cable TV is not considered OTA broadcasting, it went through a similar analog-to-digital transformation in the early 2000s.  A digital signal supports higher-resolution audio and video and can also be compressed to save bandwidth.\nInternet Broadcasting\nInternet broadcasting is the distribution of content from a single source to multiple recipients.  It is similar to multicasting, but does not limit the number of users.  For example, a multicast may transmit a video stream to 50 people, while a broadcast is available to all the users who tune into the stream.  Most streams are considered broadcasts since they are not targeted to specific users.\nSimilar to a radio broadcast, which only transmits one signal, an Internet broadcast only sends one copy of the data.  However, Internet broadcasts are not limited by physical distance and are accessible to users around the world.  When individuals connect to a stream or other Internet broadcast, the data is rerouted to multiple locations.  By the time the broadcast reaches all the connected users, it may be duplicated hundreds or thousands of times."

It can forward data between networks (serving as a bridge), but can also route data to individual systems within a network (serving as a router).\nThe main purpose of a bridge is to connect two separate networks.  It simply forwards the incoming packets from one network to the next.  A router, on the other hand, is more advanced since it can route packets to specific systems connected to the router.  A brouter combines these two functions by routing some incoming data to the correct systems, while forwarding other data to another network.  In other words, a brouter functions as a filter that lets some data into the local network, while redirecting unrecognized data to another network.\nWhile the term \"brouter\" is used to describe bridge\/router device, actual brouters are pretty rare.  Instead, most brouters are simply routers that have been configured to also function as a bridge.  This functionality can often be implemented using the router's software interface.  For example, you may configure a router to only accept data from specific protocols and data sources, while forwarding other data to another network. \nNOTE: Since routers are more complex than bridges, it is more likely for router than a bridge to function as a brouter.  Therefore, brouters are also called bridging routers."

Brownfield software development is software that is built from an existing program.

For example, each new version of Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word is developed as a brownfield project.  Even modern video games, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and StarCraft 2, are created from earlier versions of the software.\nBrownfield vs Greenfield\nBrownfield software development has many advantages over greenfield projects.  For instance, whenever a software company releases an update to a program, they have a good idea of the market for the software.  They also know what features and style of interface their users expect.  Adding new features and interface enhancements is less time consuming than developing a program from scratch.  Therefore, brownfield development is less costly and involves less risk than greenfield development."

            "A brute force attack is an attempt to gain access to a system using successive login attempts.  It can be performed manually or by using an automated script.  In either case, a brute force attack tries different username and password combinations with the hope of discovering a valid login.\nWhile brute force attacks are simplistic by nature, their implementation is often complex.  Since most servers will block a user or IP address after multiple failed logins, a hacker may use multiple systems to perform a single brute force attack.  Some attacks may use hundreds or even thousands of devices, similar to a distributed denial of service DDoS attack.\nWhile the odds of guessing a correct login via a brute force attack are low, it is still one of the most common ways online accounts are compromised.  Using enough attempts, it is theoretically possible to discover any login.  However, short and common passwords are the most vulnerable.\nHow to Protect Against Brute Force Attacks\nThe two primary ways to protect your online accounts from brute force attacks are to 1) choose strong passwords and 2) use two-factor authentication.\n1. Choose strong passwords\nA fundamental step in securing any online account is to choose a strong password.  This means choosing a password that:\n\nis long \u2013 at least eight characters, preferably 12 or more.\ncontains special characters \u2013 including numbers and symbols, as well as lowercase and uppercase characters.\nis not personally identifiable \u2013 using a special date or the name of someone close to you makes it easy for someone to manually hack your account.\n\nIt is especially important to choose a strong password for your email account since your username (half of your login) is your public email address.  Additionally, if someone gains access to your email, he or she can easily discover your other passwords.\n2. Use Two-Factor Identification\nSome services allow you to enable two-factor authentication, which requires authentication from two devices.  For example, you may be asked to enter a username and password on your computer, followed by a code sent via text to the phone number listed in your account.  With two-factor authentication, even if a hacker knows your username and password, he or she will not be able to successfully log in to your account."

For example, when you download an audio or video file from the Internet, it may load the first 20% of it into a buffer and then begin to play.  While the clip plays back, the computer continually downloads the rest of the clip and stores it in the buffer.  Because the clip is being played from the buffer, not directly from the Internet, there is less of a chance that the audio or video will stall or skip when there is network congestion.\nBuffering is used to improve several other areas of computer performance as well.  Most hard disks use a buffer to enable more efficient access to the data on the disk.  Video cards send images to a buffer before they are displayed on the screen (known as a screen buffer).  Computer programs use buffers to store data while they are running.  If it were not for buffers, computers would run a lot less efficiently and we would be waiting around a lot more."

            "In the computer world, a bug is an error in a software program.  It may cause a program to unexpectedly quit or behave in an unintended manner.  For example, a small bug may cause a button within a program's interface not to respond when you click it.  A more serious bug may cause the program to hang or crash due to an infinite calculation or memory leak.\nFrom a developer perspective, bugs can be syntax or logic errors within the source code of a program.  These errors can often be fixed using a development tool aptly named a debugger.  However, if errors are not caught before the program is compiled into the final application, the bugs will be noticed by the user.\nBecause bugs can negatively affect the usability of a program, most programs typically go through a lot of testing before they are released to the public.  For example, commercial software often goes through a beta phase, where multiple users thoroughly test all aspects of the program to make sure it functions correctly.  Once the program is determined to be stable and free from errors, it is released the public.\nOf course, as we all know, most programs are not completely error-free, even after they have been thoroughly tested.  For this reason, software developers often release \"point updates,\" (e.g. version 1.0.1), which include bug fixes for errors that were found after the software was released.  Programs that are especially \"buggy\" may require multiple point updates (1.0.2, 1.0.3, etc.) to get rid of all the bugs."

These steps are collectively known as the \"build process,\" which includes the following:\n\nChecking source code for syntax errors\nCompiling source code into machine code\nLinking libraries and other resources, such as images and media files, to the app\nGenerating a runnable application or executable file\n\nProgrammers typically use a software development application, such as an IDE, to automate the build process.  Many IDEs include a \"Build\" or \"Build and Run\" command that performs all the build steps and outputs an executable application.\nBuild (noun)\nEach version of a software program is called a build.  Some builds may be internal (not released to the public), while others are official releases.  For example, a developer may test and refine several internal builds before releasing a stable build to the public.\nSince each build is unique, the build number or ID must also be unique.  Some developers append the build ID to the public version, while others display it as a separate value.  Many applications, especially smaller ones, do not include a public build number.\nThe build ID is typically the fourth number (after the third dot) when appended to the public version.  Standard software versioning uses the following convention:\nMajor version . minor version . patch . build\nFor example, app version 4.2.17.2895 can be broken down as:\n\n4 - Major version\n2 - Minor version\n17 - Patch\n2895 - Build\n\nNOTE: In some cases, developers release different builds between automatic software updates.  For example, a developer may publish a new build after making a minor update, such as fixing a typo.  But the update is not significant enough to push out the latest version to all users.  Instead, a developer may wait until the next minor version or patch release to notify users of the update."

A single byte can be used to represent 28 or 256 different values.\nThe byte was originally created to store a single character since 256 values are sufficient to represent all lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols in western languages.  However, since some languages have more than 256 characters, modern character encoding standards, such as UTF-16, use two bytes, or 16 bits for each character.  With two bytes, it is possible to represent 216 or 65,536 values.\nWhile the byte was originally designed to store character data, it has become the fundamental unit of measurement for data storage.  For example, a kilobyte contains 1,000 bytes.  A megabyte contains 1,000 x 1,000, or 1,000,000 bytes.\nA small plain text file may only contain a few bytes of data.  However, many file systems have a minimum cluster size of 4 kilobytes, which means each file requires a minimum of 4 KB of disk space.  Therefore, bytes are more often used to measure specific data within a file rather than files themselves.  Large file sizes may be measured in megabytes, while data storage capacities are often measured in gigabytes or terabytes.\nNOTE:One kibibyte contains 1,024 bytes.

The first and last points mark the beginning and end of the path, while the intermediate points define the path's curvature.\nB\u00e9zier curves are used to create smooth curved lines, which are common in vector graphics.  Since they are defined by control points, B\u00e9zier curves can be resized without losing their smooth appearance.  Raster graphics, on the other hand, define each pixel within an image and appear blocky or pixleated when enlarged.\nThere are several types of B\u00e9zier curves, including linear, quadratic, and higher-order curves.  A linear curve is a straight line defined by two points.  A quadratic curve includes intermediate points that pull the control points, and therefore the path, in different directions.  A higher-order curve may include additional intermediate points that fine tune how the path follows each control point.\nThe shape of a B\u00e9zier curve is calculated using interpolation, a method of approximating the path of the line between each control point.   Since computer screens display graphics using pixels, B\u00e9zier curves are always approximated when displayed on a screen.  If you zoom in on a B\u00e9zier curve using a drawing program or CAD software, you will see a more accurate representation of the path.\nNOTE: B\u00e9zier curves are named after French engineer Pierre B\u00e9zier, which is why the \"B\" is always capitalized."
